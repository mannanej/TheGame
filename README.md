# TheGame

This is an attempt at a basic text based game. It is all in a basic C++ command window, and it plays as if the computer is playing with you. It is based on inputs
from the user, and the computer will "responde" in various ways depending on your choices. Nowhere near finished, but this was my practice for getting used to using C++.
