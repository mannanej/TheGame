Preface
This script represents a synthesis of several postgraduate courses given at the
Institute of Physics of São Carlos (IFSC) of the University of São Paulo (USP). The
courses are Quantum Mechanics (SFI5774), Atomic and Molecular Physics (SFI5814),
Quantum Mechanics B (SFI5707), Interaction of Light and Matter (SFI5905), and
Atomic Optics (SFI5887). The topics of the courses are, of course, closely intertwined.
The purpose of this composite script is to emphasize the interconnection of topics
and facilitate the understanding of how they are related. In part I we introduce the
quantum mechanics, which represents the fundamental theory for the rest of the book.
In the second part we focus on the structure of the atom. In the third and fourth
part we study the properties of light, its interaction with individual atoms and atomic
ensembles and how the interaction is influenced by cavities and surfaces. Finally, in
part V we introduce the optics of matter wave.
The course is intended for masters and PhD students in physics. The script
is a preliminary version continually being subject to corrections and modifications.
Error notifications and suggestions for improvement are always welcome. The script
incorporates exercises the solutions of which can be obtained from the author.
Information and announcements regarding the course will be published on the
website:
http://www.ifsc.usp.br/ strontium/ − > Teaching − > Semester
The student’s assessment will be based on written tests and a seminar on a special
topic chosen by the student. In the seminar the student will present the chosen topic
in 15 minutes. He will also deliver a 4-page scientific paper in digital form. Possible
topics are:
- Observation of super- and subradiant spontaneous emission of two ions (Exc. 20.1.8.8),

Antecedents of quantum
mechanics
Developed at the beginning of the 20th century, quantum mechanics is today the
most fundamental and abrageant theory in physics. Despite its long history and its
incomparable success, it is far from being exhausted. Quantum information science
has matured to a point to be able to trigger important technological progress, such
that we are today at the verge of a new quantum revolution 2.0, from which we expect
profound scientific, economic, and societal changes.
This chapter traces briefly the historical conditions and the discoveries that led to
the invention of quantum mechanics.

1.1

The discovery of the atom

The fundamental idea of quantum mechanics is the assumption of the existence of
entities that, reaching a limit, can no longer be subdivided. Examples are the mass of
a body, the speed of an electron orbiting an atom, or the intensity of a beam of light.
This idea was first uttered by Leucippus 500 years a.c. and his student Democritus,
who imagined matter being made of smallest particles which they called atoms. These
atoms move freely, collide, combine, and separate: ’There is nothing more than atoms
and free space.’ The microscopic atoms would have the same characteristics as the
macroscopic objects they form when they combine, for example, color and shape.
The idea of the atom resurfaced and was refined in the course of the 18th century (see
Tab. 1.1 below). Today, we know that the basic idea was good, but the reality is a
little more complicated.
At the end of the 19th century, the physical world seemed simple: matter and light
was all that existed. Matter was made up of atoms and light was a wave. Therefore,
to describe a real system, it was enough to calculate the trajectories of its elementary
particles, the propagation of light and the way they interact. We now know that life
is not as simple, and that atoms are also waves and light also behaves like particles.
Frictions between the old notions and new observations appeared in the late 19th
century, such as the ultraviolet divergence of black-body radiation. The pioneer of the
new ideas was Max Planck who, in 1905, with a little help from Einstein quantized
the electromagnetic field, and therefore the light, into small harmonic oscillators.
This was the starting point for the development of a new theory called quantum
mechanics. Soon, this theory was applied to explain the photoelectric effect. The

Democrit’s model

’The principles of reality are atoms and emptiness while other things are mere opinions.’ This is a quotation from the Greek philosopher Democritus 400 years before
Christ and before Socrates. Together with his teacher Leucippus, he formed the first
idea of indivisible particles: atoms.
Democritus’ work only survived as second-hand accounts, the major part of it
having been written down by Aristotle, who also, defending the idea of the contin-

uum, was the greatest critic of Democritus’ theory. Aristotle said that the reasoning
that guided Democritus to affirm the existence of atoms was as follows. For a body to
change its shape, it is necessary that its parts can move. This presupposes an emptiness (or vacuum) in which the matter moves. But if matter were divided infinitely
into ever smaller parts, it would loose its consistency. Nothing could be formed because nothing could arise from the ever more infinitely deep dilution of matter into
emptiness. Hence, he concluded that the division of matter can not be infinite, that
is, there is an indivisible limit: the atom. ’There is only atoms and emptiness’, he
said.
Observing dust particles in a whirling motion within a ray of sunlight, Democritus
was led to the idea that atoms would behave in the same way, randomly colliding,
some crowding, others dispersing, others never yet joining with another atom.
The consistency of clusters of atoms, which makes something look solid, liquid,
gaseous, or animated (which is the state of the soul) would then be determined by the
shape of the atoms involved and their spatial arrangement. In this sense, water atoms
are smooth and slippery; the atoms of steel have shapes with sharp edges that hold
them solidly together; the atoms of salt, as their taste shows, are harsh and pointed;
the atoms of air are small and little connected, penetrating all other materials; and
the atoms of soul and fire are spherical and very delicate.

Figure 1.3: Atoms of steel and air, atoms of the soul, and Bohr’s atom model.

We know nowadays that Democritus’ first theory of the structure of matter was
very close to the truth: There really are indivisible particles called atoms composed
of a nucleus and an electronic shell, and the space between the atomic nuclei is, in
fact, quite empty.

6

CHAPTER 1. ANTECEDENTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

The atomic hypothesis came to be reborn in the modern age with the scientists
Boyle, Clausius, Maxwell, and Boltzmann due to their successful explanations of the
properties of gases based on the so-called kinetic theory, where they assumed a gas
being constituted of identical molecules that collided elastically with each other and
with the walls of the recipient containing them. The discovery of the atom through
the laws of proportions in chemistry and the establishment of Avogadro’s number
considerably strengthened the atomic hypothesis. The hypothesis was definitely consecrated with the various experiments that established the charge of the electron and
the mass ratio between electrons and protons.
By the beginning of the 19th century the atomic nature of matter had definitely
been established, and the basic composition of the atoms was already relatively well
known. It was known, through experiments, that electrons could be removed from
neutral atoms thus creating positively charged ions and that only a certain number
of electrons could be removed from each atom. This number proved to be dependent
on the atomic species and was called the atomic number Z. This information was
fundamental for establishing the basic composition of atoms. The question that arose
at this point concerned the dimensions and configurations of the atomic system. How
would loads and masses be distributed in this entity?

1.1.2

Thomson’s model and Rutherford’s experiment

The internal structure of a body can be studied by throwing beams of small particles against it. The detection of the angular distribution of the scattered particles
gives access to the structure factor of the body. In crystallography we throw X-rays
into super-complicated molecules to learn the architecture e.g. of proteins. And in
medicine, X-rays reveal the internal structure of the human body. Obviously, the
scattering technique is an extremely powerful tool, used in many areas of modern
physics.
In a series of experiments done before 1911, Ernest Rutherford analyzed the internal structure of gold atoms using α-particles, i.e., He2+ atoms. The experiments
carried out by Geiger, Marsden, and Rutherford consisted of observing the deflection
of particles from a collimated beam when scattered by a thin metallic sheet (gold of
thickness ∼ 1 µm) carefully obtained by electroplating [see Fig. 1.4(cd)].
The atomic model proposed by Joseph John Thomson suggests a structure resembling a pudding with raisins: the electrons would be homogeneously distributed
within an extended nucleus (size 0.1 nm) of positive charge thus compensating for
the negative charge of the electrons. The α-particles would penetrate the gold nucleus, perceived as almost homogeneous, but would suffer multiple deflections due to
collisions with the disordered electrons within the nucleus. Since electrons are very
light, the angle of deflection θ would be small, even after many collisions. For this
model we expect a Gaussian dependence of the particles’ deflection angle given by
the scattering cross section [see Fig. 1.4(a-b)],
2

dσ
∝ e−θ /θ0 ,
dΩ

(1.1)

where θ0 is a small angle.
However, the measurements performed on this Rutherford scattering showed different results:

atom.

 For a fixed scattering angle, the amount of particles scattered into a solid angle
element dΩ is proportional to the thickness of the metal foil.
 For a given fixed angle and a given metal sheet the amount of scattered particles
2
in dΩ varies inversely with Ekin
, where Ekin is the kinetic energy of the αparticles.
 For a given energy and a given metal sheet, the number of particles scattered
into dΩ is proportional to (sin θ2 )−4 .
 For a given energy and sheet thickness, the number of particles scattered into
2
dΩ in a given direction is proportional to Ztg
, where Ztg is the atomic number
of the element that constitutes the sheet.

The extremely rare deflection of α-particles and their angular distribution can be
understood by the assumption that the positive charge is concentrated in a very small
volume (∼ 1 fm, that is 10000 times less than the size of the atom itself). This volume
is called the atomic nucleus, hence the denomination of nuclear model. Since most of
the particles pass through the gold sheet without hindrance, there must be a large
gap between the nuclei. The electrons, which move within a large (in comparison with
the diameter of the nucleus) empty space (the vacuum) around the nucleus, shield
the positive nuclear charge, so that the atom appears outwardly neutral.
We now derive Rutherford’s scattering formula from the hypothesis of a point-like
nucleus. Due to the repulsive action of the Coulomb force,

we have for the trajectory of the α-particle (Zα = 2) a hyperbola [see Fig. 1.5(a)].
The large half-axis of the hyperbola can be determined from the following ansatz,
Ekin =

Zα Ztg e2 1
,
4πε0 2a

(1.3)

where 2a is the minimum distance of the particle α, when it collides with the nucleus
in a central collision 1 . The distance a depends on the kinetic energy and can also
be used for non-central collisions. The collision parameter b is the minimum distance
of the α-particle to the nucleus, if it continued to fly in a straight line. In fact the
α-particle will be deflected by an angle θ. From the geometry of the hyperbola, as
2φ + θ = 180◦ , we obtain the following equation:
tan φ =

Here, we have to make some comments:
 The angle θ = 0 is not defined, since there exists a minimum deflection angle

simply by inverting the formula (1.5). For very large impact parameters, that
is, when the α-particle passes the atom outside its electronic layer, the electrons
of the atom shield the charge of the nucleus, an effect called screening.
 For very high energies, the distribution of the nuclear charge over a finite volume influences the scattering, calling for corrections in the Rutherford formula.
Moreover, at short internuclear distances, nuclear forces appear additionally to
the electromagnetic interaction.

Rutherford derived the formula (1.12) describing the scattering of α-particles
within classical physics. A derivation from the laws governing quantum mechanics
using the Born approximation shows that Rutherford’s formula describes scattering
correctly in first order, and that purely quantum effects present only minor corrections. We will review the Rutherford scattering in Excs. 1.1.6.1 and 1.1.6.2 and discuss
the screening effect in Exc. 1.1.6.3.

1.1.3

Emission of radiation in the planetary model

The planetary model proposed by Rutherford suggests electrons spinning around a
positively charged nucleus in circular orbits 2 . This motion of electrons should obey
the laws of Maxwell’s electrodynamic theory. Let us now calculate some consequences
of this picture.
We now treat the atom as a rotor where the negative particle, the electron, orbits
the positive particle. The dipole moment is,
p0 = −er .

(1.16)

2 This type of model had already been proposed by Jean Perrin in 1901 and by Hantaro Nagaoka
in 1903, around the same time when Thompson developed his model. The planetary model was later
on rescued by John William Nicholson in 1911.

Zeeman effect in the planetary model

The orbital motion of the electron generates a ring current I = e/T = eω/2π, which
produces an orbital magnetic moment which, as shown in Exc. 1.1.6.5, can be calculated following the laws of electromagnetism,
µ
~ ` = IAn̂ =

(1.25)

We now imagine this atom in the presence of a magnetic field B oriented in the
direction that we will call z. This results in a precession of the magnetic moment
around the field (similar to the precession of a spinning top in the presence of a
gravitational field) governed by the equation,

frequency. It is evident that the presence of the magnetic field considerably alters
the state of the atom, even producing profound modifications in the frequency of the
orbit of the electron ω0 and therefore in the energetic state of the atom. This change
is called Zeeman effect.
The Zeeman effect can be calculated by imagining that the field has an arbitrary
direction with respect to L. In this case, the equation describing the electronic motion
as resulting from an equilibrium between the centrifugal force and the Coulomb force
needs to be complemented by a Lorentz force,

me r̈ + me ω02 r = FL = −ev × B .

(1.26)

where mr̈ is the centrifugal force due to the circular motion of the electron and
me ω02 r the centripetal force due to the Coulomb attraction exerted by the nucleus.
Assuming the direction of the magnetic field given by B = Bêz with B = 2me ΩL /e,
the equations of motion can be decomposed into,
ẍ + ω02 x + 2ΩL ẏ = 0
ÿ +

ω02 y

(1.27)

− 2ΩL ẋ = 0

z̈ + ω02 z = 0 .

The z-direction is not influenced. With the ansatz x = aeıωt and y = beıωt we obtain
the system of equations,

where the abbreviation µB = e~/2me ' 9.27 · 10−24 JT−1 is called the magneton

Although the classical derivation shows quantitative deviations from experimental
observations, it is quite interesting, as it illustrates several aspects which have a
quantum mechanical equivalence.
Example 1 (Stern-Gerlach experiment): Among several historical experiments carried out to unravel the atomic structure, one of the most important is
the experiment carried out by Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach in 1922 to measure the magnetic moment of atoms. The results of this experiment once again
demonstrated the need for new concepts to explain the observations.
Using Bohr’s quantization rule, L = n~, within the formula (1.25) we get,
µ
~ = −µB

~

In the presence of a magnetic field the dipole undergoes an interaction W =

µ · B, and therefore a feels a force,
F = −~
µ · ∇B .
By subjecting beams of atoms to the gradient of a magnetic field and detecting this force, Stern and Gerlach were able to measure the magnetic moment
produced by the rotation of the electrons around the atomic nuclei.

1.1.5

Bohr’s theory and its limitations

The classical model of the planetary atom provides a mechanical illustration of the
microscopic world but fails to quantitatively explain experimental observations such
as the discrete nature of atomic spectra.
The radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms is characterized by discrete, spectrally
very thin lines. The observed lines are grouped in series named after Lyman, Ballmer

where m and n are integers. RH = (1/4π)2 (me e4 /4π~3 c) is the Rydberg constant
and µ = me mat /(me + mat ) the reduced mass.
The discrete nature of spectral lines and the problem of the radiation collapse led
Niels Bohr to formulate the following postulates:
1. There are specific stationary orbits, where electrons do not emit energy.
2. Each emission or absorption of radiation energy by electrons comes with a transition between stationary orbits. The radiation emitted during this transition
is homogeneous.
3. The laws of mechanics can describe the dynamic equilibrium of electrons in stationary states, but fails to describe the transition of electrons between stationary
orbits.
Thus, Bohr’s model predicts the quantization of energy levels, known as first quantization of quantum mechanics. The radii of the possible orbits can be calculated from
the postulate that the orbital angular momentum be quantized in units of ~, that is,
the electrons form stationary de Broglie waves along the orbits 3 . We discuss Bohr’s
model in Excs. 1.1.6.6 and 1.1.6.7.
In the picture proposed by Bohr, the radiative decay happens as an abrupt transition of an electron between an outer (more energetic) orbit and an inner (less energetic) orbit. Since the energies of stationary orbits are very well defined, the emitted
radiation is mono-energetic, i.e., the spectrum consists of discrete characteristic lines.
We note here that the picture of an abrupt transition of electrons between discrete
states, called the quantum jump, did not receive Schrödinger’s blessing. He rather
imagined for electrons, within his theory of quantum wave mechanics, wave-shaped
orbitals instead of planetary trajectories, thus avoiding the problem of radiation due
to charge deceleration and the quantum jump concept. According to him, during a
transition between electronic orbits, the energy is transformed into radiation gradually 4 .

force, 2. quantization of phase

The discovery of the photon

The concept of the nature of light has a variable history. Newton proposed around
∼1650 a corpuscular model to explain Snellius’ law on the refraction of a light beam
penetrating a crystal. Around the same time Huygens found a wave-based interpretation. The two models predicted different speeds of light within the dense medium.
Newton found, that the speed of light is greater in the medium than outside, while
Huygens found the opposite 5 . In the late 1800’s the wave nature of light was established through observations of interference effects confirming Huygens’ hypothesis.
At that time, the world appeared to be simple: Light was a wave and matter was
composed of particles. However, some observations made were incompatible with this
simplistic ideas, for example, the spectrum of blackbody radiation, the Compton effect, the specific heat of the solid, the radiation pressure, and the photoelectric effect.
All these observations are readily understood by assuming a corpuscular nature of
the light 6 .
Nowadays, knowing the theory of quantum mechanics, we know that both ideas
have their range of validity and that the electromagnetic radiation is dual: In general,
propagation and interference effects are best described by waves. However, when
interacting with matter, light tends to localize into small particles called photons.

1.2.1

Radiation in a conductive cavity

In the age of lasers a classical treatment of the emission and absorption of light
may seem an atavism. However, even with coherent and monochromatic radiation
sources, the most commonly used physical picture is that of a classical optical field
interacting with an atom or a molecule whose energetic structure is treated quantum
mechanically. And even the atomic or molecular dipole is often treated like a classical
oscillator. The exposition of such a dipole to simple boundary conditions prepares
the analogous development of a quantum oscillator and provides a direct path to
quantization of the radiation field.
5 Note, until today there remain doubts about the correct value of the momentum of light in
dielectric media [433].
6 The corpuscular hypothesis is now called the second quantization of quantum theory or quantization of the electromagnetic field.

1.2. THE DISCOVERY OF THE PHOTON

17

Even if we rarely do experiments by throwing light into a small hole in a metallic
box, the electromagnetic fields obtained by solving Maxwell’s equation are particularly
simple for boundary conditions, where the fields disappear on the inner surfaces of
the box. Before discussing the physics of radiation in a perfectly conducting cavity,
we have to introduce some basic relations between electromagnetic amplitudes, stored
energy, and intensity.
The electric field of a plane wave oscillating with frequency ω and propagating
through vacuum in the direction of propagation defined by the wave vector,
k=

2π
k̂ ,
λ

(1.33)

can be written,
E = E0 ei(k·r−ωt) ,

(1.34)

where E0 = E0 ê consists of an amplitude E0 and a polarization ê. Since the field
E0 is transverse to the direction of propagation, the polarization has two components
perpendicular to k. The magnetic induction field associated with the wave is,
B0 = 1c E0 .

(1.35)

For a propagating wave E and B are in phase, while for a standing wave they are out
of phase.
For a given cavity mode we can express the standing wave in this mode as,
E = E0 (r)e−iωt .

(1.36)

The energy of the electromagnetic field of a standing wave, averaged over one oscillation of the frequency ω is,

fields are equal. Therefore,
Z
Ū = 12 ε0 |E|2 dV
and
ū = 12 ε0 |E|2 .
(1.39)
Another important quantity is the flux of electromagnetic energy through a surface.
The Poynting vector describing this flux is defined by,
I=

(1.40)

Again using the equation (1.35), we find the value averaged over a time period,
I¯ = 12 ε0 c|E|2 .

(1.41)

18

CHAPTER 1. ANTECEDENTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

This quantity, called intensity, describes the fact that the flux is a density of energy
multiplied with the velocity of propagation in vacuum,

1.2.2

Black body radiation

We now want to calculate the energy density inside the cavity before using the result to
describe the interaction between light and a sample of two-level atoms located inside
the cavity. The basic idea is to say that the electrons inside the conducting surface
of the cavity oscillate because of thermal motion. The oscillation generates a dipolar
radiation leading to stationary waves developing within the cavity. As the walls of the
cavity are conducting, the electric field E must disappear inside the wall and on its
surfaces. The task is now twofold: first count the number of possible standing waves,
which satisfy the boundary conditions as a function of frequency; second, determine
the energy for each wave and then calculate the spectral distribution of the energy
within the cavity.
The equations describing the radiated energy in free space are,
∇2 E =

1 ∂2E
c2 ∂t2

and

∇·E=0 .

(1.45)

The stationary waves solutions separate into terms oscillating in time and in space.

Figure 1.8: (a) Cavity in position space showing the thermal motion of the electrons inside
the walls. (b and c) Density-of-states in a cavity in momentum space.

Now, respecting the boundary conditions for a three-dimensional box of length L, we

have for the components of E 7 ,
E(r, t) = e−iωt [êx cos(kx x) sin(ky y) sin(kz z)

with the components,

for

and similar for ky and kz . Note, that for each component Ex,y,z the transverse
amplitudes disappear in 0 and L. By inserting this solution into Helmholtz’s equation
(1.45), we obtain,

kx2 + ky2 + kz2 = 2 .

The states kx,y,z (enumerated by nx,y,z ) form a three-dimensional orthogonal lattice

However, the periodic boundary conditions for |k| limit the components kx , ky , kz

the degeneracy of polarizations,

The density of oscillating modes within the cavity grows like the square of the
frequency. Now, the mean energy per mode in a sample of oscillators in thermal
equilibrium is, following the equipartition law, equal to,
Ē = kB T ,

Planck’s distribution of modes

We obtained the result (1.54) by multiplying the number of modes with the mean
energy per mode. As there is no doubt about our method of counting the modes, the
problem with the ultraviolet catastrophe can only root in the use of the equipartition
principle for assigning energy to the oscillators.
Planck’s idea to solve this problem was to first consider the probability distribution for exciting the modes (thermal states) for a sample of oscillators in thermal
equilibrium at temperature T . This probability distribution p comes from mechanical
statistics and can be written
in terms of the Boltzmann factor, e−En /kB T , and the
P∞ −E
partition function q = n=0 e n /kB T as,
pn =

(1.56)

The corpuscular nature of the photon

1.2.4.1

The photoelectric effect

Light incident on a metallic surface can expel electrons. For this to occur, the light
must have a minimum frequency. If the frequency is below this value, there is no
point in increasing the light intensity: the electrons won’t be expelled. The main
experimental observations are: 1. Electrons are ejected without apparent delay, i.e. it
is not necessary (and it doesn’t help) to accumulate a certain amount of energy.
2. Higher light intensities increase the number of electrons, but not their kinetic
energy after expulsion. 3. Red light does not eject electrons, even at high intensities.
4. Weak ultraviolet light only ejects few electrons, but with high kinetic energy.
These observations challenge the classical electromagnetic model according to
which the Lorentz acceleration of the electrons should be proportional to the field

22

amplitude. The observations were explained by Einstein’s theory of the photoelectric effect, which assumes the light to be quantized (unlike Planck, who preferred to
quantize the process of light absorption),
E = hν .

The energy of the fastest electrons is measured through the decelerating voltage by
varying ν and I. We will discuss the photoelectric effect quantitatively later in the
Exc. 6.4.6.7.
1.2.4.2

Bremsstrahlung and the Franck-Hertz experiment

Bremsstrahlung is, in a way, the inverse process of the photoelectric effect. Here,
electrons are accelerated toward a cathode. Finding a target they are rapidly decelerated, a process in which they emit a continuous spectrum of X-rays (in addition to
characteristic lines attributed to electronic transitions in the target atoms). For any
given kinetic energy the spectra have a red threshold corresponding to photons that
receive the entire energy of the electron.
In the Franck-Hertz experiment free electrons produced in a plasma are accelerated by a strong electric field. Having traveled a sufficiently long distance they have
acquired enough kinetic energy to excite electronic transitions in the atoms of the
plasma. When an excitation occurs, the electron suddenly loses all its energy and
must be accelerated again, starting from rest, before it can excite another atom.
1.2.4.3

Radiative pressure and Compton scattering

When light is scattered from a particle, it transfers momentum to it called photonic
recoil. This effect, known as radiation pressure, occurs for example in Compton scattering.
X-rays scattered by the electrons of a carbon target are red-shifted by an amount,
which increases with the scattering angle. This is the Compton effect. The data
are understood assuming a corpuscular nature of light and applying the laws of conservation of energy and momentum to the collision processes between photons and
electrons. The scattered photon sees its energy reduced and therefore its wavelength
increased.
In a material where there are free electrons, this effect will occur at all photon
energies. In other materials, it is only observed with high energy photons. For high
energy photons, exceeding the atomic binding energy, the electrons can be considered
free such that, in the scattering process, the photon is able to eject the electron from
its atom. The photon receives the remaining energy and is deviated, such that the
overall momentum of the system is conserved. The loss of energy for the photon
results in a spectral shift to the red during its passage through the material.
Photons of visible light, on the other hand, do not have enough energy to eject
bound electrons. In this case, the mass in the Compton formula must be replaced by

1.2. THE DISCOVERY OF THE PHOTON

23

the atomic mass, such that the spectral displacement becomes much smaller. This
limit, which involves bound electrons, is that of Thomson and Rayleigh scattering.
The relevance of this effect lies in the fact that it shows that light exhibits properties commonly attributed to corpuscles, since Thomson’s scattering model, based
on the classical theory of charged particles accelerated by electromagnetic fields, can
not explain any spectral shift.

1.2.5

Einstein’s transitions rates

Bohr’s atom model explained for the first, time how light interacts with matter:
Atoms have discrete excitation levels. They absorb and emit energy packets ~ω.
Unfortunately, Bohr’s model can not predict transition rates. Here, Einstein helped
out by developing a useful theory (see Fig. 1.10).

Figure 1.10: Bohr model and Einstein rate diagram.

We consider a two-level atom or a sample of atoms within a conducting cavity.
We have N1 atoms in the lower energy state E1 and N2 in the upper state E2 . Light
interacts with these atoms through stimulated resonant absorption and emission. The
rates, B12 u(ω) and B21 u(ω) are proportional to the energy spectral density u(ω) of
the cavity modes. The central idea of Einstein is to postulate that atoms in the higher
state can emit light spontaneously at a rate A21 , which depends only on the density
of modes of the cavity, i.e. the volume of the cavity, but not the energy of the field
of radiation. With the Einstein coefficients we can formulate valid rate equations in
situations, where the spectral distribution of the radiation is wider than the spectral
width of the atomic transition and where the spectral distribution of the light flux
¯
from the source, I(ω),
is weak compared to the saturation intensity of the atomic
transition. Even if modern light sources generally have very narrow and intense
spectral emission bands, Einstein’s coefficients are often used in the spectroscopic
literature to characterize the light-matter interaction with atoms and molecules.
The Einstein rate equations describe the energy flux between atoms and the optical
modes of the cavity,

R1→2 is the absorption rate, R2→1 the stimulated emission rate and S2→1 the spontaneous emission rate. The assumption of a third type of transition, called spontaneous
emission, is necessary, if B12 = B21 but N1 > N2 in thermal equilibrium. In thermal

This expression shows that, when ~(ω2 − ω1 )  kB T , that is, for optical, UV, or Xray frequencies, spontaneous emission dominates. But in low-frequency regimes, that
is, IR, microwave, or radio waves, stimulated emission is more important. Note that
even when stimulated emission dominates, spontaneous emission is always present and
plays an important role, for example, in processes ultimately limiting the emission
bandwidth of lasers.

1.2.6

Absorption spectrum for a single atom

Every light source has a certain spectral width. Conventional light sources, such
as incandescent bulbs or plasmas have relatively broad emission bands compared to
atomic or molecular absorbers, at least when the latter ones are studied in dilute
gases. Even when we use pure spectral sources, such as a laser tuned to the peak
of a resonance, the transition line always exhibits an intrinsic width associated with
the interruption of the phase evolution of the excited state. Phase interruptions such
as spontaneous or stimulated emission and collisions are common examples of line
broadening mechanisms. The emission or absorption of radiation occurs within a

spectral distribution in our calculation of the energy transfer.
The total power P absorbed by a two-level atom with resonance frequency ω0 from
a radiation field with the

of the laser beam I¯ = I(ω)dω can be expressed as the integral,

Broad laser driving a broad transition

Until now we assumed a fixed laser frequency ωL (with finite emission bandwidth)
driving a fixed resonance frequency ω0 . What we call absorption spectrum is what
we obtain when we tune either the laser frequency or when we (somehow) vary the
resonance frequency, such that ∆ ≡ ωL − ω0 is ramped. Assuming Lorentzian profiles
with finite linewidths for both, I¯ and σ, we get,

This result reproduces the two limiting cases discussed in the above example, since
for narrow transitions, Γ → 0, that is LΓ → δ, we recover the results (1.79), and for
narrow lasers, β → 0, that is, Lβ → δ, we recover (1.76). Obviously, this formula holds
for other line profiles e.g. when the resonance is broadened by some perturbations 9 .

Absorption in a gas

Let us now generalize the results to a gas of two-level atoms. As long as the transition linewidth is narrow [case (1.77)], the power is removed from the system only
by spontaneous emission; absorption only converts radiation into atomic excitation
which, subsequently, can be returned to the radiation field by stimulated emission.
At steady-state the Einstein rate equation (1.65) reads,
0 = −N1 B12 u(ω0 ) + N2 B21 u(ω0 ) + N2 A21 .

(1.84)

Using the result (1.69), we can write the amount of power removed from the system
by spontaneous emission as,
P = N2 A21 ~ω0 = u(ω0 )B12 (N1 −

g1
g2 N2 )~ω0

.

(1.85)

On the other hand, the power absorbed from the radiation field u(ω0 ), by atoms
whose transition is described by the cross section (1.73), is given by,
Z
P = (N1 − gg21 N2 )σ(ω)I(ω)dω .
(1.86)
Remembering I(ω) = cu(ω) and assuming a large radiation spectrum, I(ω) ' I(ω0 ),

is the Lambert-Beer law for light absorption. It is very useful for measuring atomic
densities in gas cells or of atomic beams [412, 389, 645]. Solve the Excs. 1.2.10.9 to
1.2.10.11.

1.2.8

Saturation

Strong driving of a transition leads to its saturation and causes line broadening. To
see this we go back to Einstein’s rate equations in steady-state (1.65) additionally
simplifying by assuming g1 = 1 = g2 , such that B12 = B21 . Resolving these equations
by N1 and N2 and using N1 + N2 = N and N1 − N2 ≡ ∆N , we get,
N1 = N

and

N2 = N

For vanishing pump rate we expect, N1 −→ N and N2 −→ 0. In contrast, when
u→∞
the pump rate becomes much larger than the relaxation rates, N1 , N2 −→ 12 . This
means that the absorption coefficient α = σ(N1 − N2 ) goes to zero, and the medium
becomes completely transparent,
∆N = N

(1.98)

Let us now remember that the absorption cross section (1.73) of a homogeneously
broadened line is Lorentzian. This means that the saturation parameter itself becomes
Lorentzian. We can assume that the relaxation rate A21 is independent of ω within
the frequency range of the line profile,
s(ω) = s(ω0 )

where we introduced the increased halfwidth of the Lorentzian profile,

γs ≡ Γ 1 + s(ω0 ) .

(1.100)

(1.101)

Apparently, the halfwidth of the saturation-broadened line increases with the resonant
saturation parameter s(ω0 ). If according to (1.94) the induced transition rate at
resonance equals the total relaxation rate A21 /2, the resonant √
saturation parameter
becomes s(ω0 ) = 1, which increases the linewidth by a factor 2, compared to the
unsaturated linewidth Γ for weak radiation fields. Starting from (1.100) we can define
a saturated absorption cross section,

∆2 + (γ/2)2

(1.103)

This shows that the saturation decreases the absorption coefficient by the factor
1 + s(ω). At the line center, this factor has its maximum value 1 + s(ω0 ), while it
decreases to 1 for increasing |∆|, see (1.101), see Fig. 1.12. This is the reason why
the line broadens.
From (1.96) we see, that unity saturation, s(ω0 ) = 1, corresponds to a light

Specific heat of solids

The Debye model applies Planck’s law on the distribution of energy in electromagnetic
radiation, which treats radiation as a gas of photons, to the energy distribution of
atomic vibrations in a solid, treating them as a gas of phonons in a box (the box being
the solid). Most of the steps of the calculation are identical, as both are examples of
a massless bosonic gas with linear dispersion relation.
According to the equipartition theorem, every atom has 3 degrees of freedom due
to its translational motion. Thus, in a crystal lattice with N atoms, we expect the
total energy E = 3N kB T and the specific heat should be, following the Dulong-Petit
law,


∂E
CV =

(1.108)

for all solids regardless of temperature.
It was observed, however, that the specific heat of solids decreases like CV ∝ T 3 as
T approaches zero. It was Einstein’s idea to apply Planck’s formula by treating the N
atoms as three-dimensional harmonic oscillators vibrating in a lattice. The discrete
energies n~ω are identified with quasi-particles called phonons. The quantum nature
of atoms does not matter, they just provide the medium supporting the phonons.
Following the Bose-Einstein statistics, we must replace,
kB T → ~ω/(e~ω/kB T − 1) ,

allow a spectrum of vibrational frequencies. With the density of states,
ρ(ν)dν = (4πV v 3 )ν 2 dν ,

(1.112)

where v is the velocity of sound propagation, the formula is totally equivalent to the
density-of-states for photons in a cavity. Assuming thatR there is an upper bound νm

Foundations and
mathematical tools
In this chapter, we will introduce step by step the formalism of quantum mechanics
by gradually increasing the degree of abstraction. Applications of the formalism will
be shown in consecutive chapters.

2.1

Basic notions

The aim of this section is to give ’feeling’ for the new concepts introduced and used
by quantum mechanics. We will first motivate the fundamental quantum equations
of motion by linking them to classical dispersion relations and then spend some time
to discuss the probabilistic concept proposed by Max Born.

2.1.1

Dispersion relation and Schrödinger equation

A fundamental problem in physics is the issue of the propagation of physical entities.
On one hand, we have the light, whose propagation in the vacuum is described by the
dispersion relation ω = ck or,
ω 2 − c2 k 2 = 0 .
(2.1)
Since light is a wave, in the most general form, assuming the validity
R of the superposition principle, it can be described by a wave packet, A(r, t) = eı(k·r−ωt) a(k)d3 k.
It is easy to verify that the wave equation,
∂2
A − c2 ∇2 A = 0 ,
∂t2

(2.2)

reproduces the dispersion relation.
On the other hand, we have slow massive particles possessing kinetic energy,
E=

p2
.
2m

(2.3)

With the hypothesis of de Broglie that even a massive particle has wave quality, we
can try an ansatz 1 of a wave equation satisfying the dispersion relation (2.3). From

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

Planck’s formula, E = ~ω, and the formula
R of Louis de Broglie, p = ~k, describing
the particle by a wave packet ψ(r, t) = eı(k·r−ωt) ϕ(k)d3 k not subject to external
forces, it is easy to verify that the equation,

2.1.2

Relativistic particle waves

Despite the similarities between light particles and material particles, there are notable differences: The photon is a relativistic particle with no rest mass. How can we
establish a relationship between such different objects?
To clarify this relationship we now consider particles that are similar to light
in the sense that they have high velocities, that is, relativistic particles. From the
relativistic principle of the equivalence of mass and energy, we obtain for a massive
particle E 2 = m2 c4 + c2 p2 or,
ω 2 − c2 k 2 =

m2 c4

inserting, for example, the already proposed wave packet A(r, t) = eı(k·r−ωt) a(k)d3 k,
supposed not to be subject to external forces. The equation (2.7) is a wave equation
called Klein-Gordon equation. For particles without rest mass, as in the case of photons, the equation is reduced to the wave equation of light (2.2).
Now, making the transition to non-relativistic velocities, v  c, we can expand

It is interesting to note that in all cases discussed, obviously the dispersion relations

and

p −→ −ı~∇ .

(2.11)

We will discuss this later in the context of Ehrenfest’s theorem in Secs. 2.1.6, 2.1.7,
and 2.4.6.

2.1.3

Born’s interpretation

The first part of this script is devoted to individual particles or systems of distinguishable massive particles, and we will only turn our attention to light and indistinguishable particles when discussing the (second) quantization of fields.
According to our current conviction, the complete reality (neglecting relativistic
effects) on any system is contained in the Schrödinger equation (2.5). That statement
does not make us smarter without having to explaining the meaning of the wavefunction ψ. In an attempt to marry the concepts of particles and waves, Max Born
proposed in 1926 the interpretation of the quantity
Z
|ψ(r, t)|2 d3 r
(2.12)
V

as probability of finding the particle inside the volume V .
If |ψ(r, t)|2 has the meaning of a probability density or probability distribution, the
square of the wavefunction must be integrable,
Z
kψ(r, t)k2 ≡
|ψ(r, t)|2 d3 r < ∞ .
(2.13)
R3

This allows us to proceed to a normalization of the wave function,
ψ̃(r, t) ≡ qR

such that kψ̃(r, t)k = 1.

Continuity equation

In quantum mechanics we associate the wavefunction that describes a quantum system
to a probability wave. As the Schrödinger equation describes a time evolution, in
order to be useful, the wavefunction must allow for probability flows. We define the
probability density and the probability flow by,
ρ(r, t) ≡ ψ ∗ (r, t)ψ(r, t) ,
~
j(r, t) ≡
[ψ ∗ (r, t)∇ψ(r, t) − ψ(r, t)∇ψ ∗ (r, t)] .

Starting from the Schrödinger equation we can easily derive the continuity equation

current which flows through the

surface S delimiting the probability charge Q ≡ V ρ(r, t)d3 r, we obtain,
−Q̇ = I .

(2.18)

The continuity equation is obviously similar to that of electromagnetism.

2.1.5

Distributions in space and time

So far we only spoke of spatial distributions, ψ(r, t). But we could also consider velocity or moment distributions. In classical mechanics, a particle has a well-defined
position and velocity. Knowing the position and velocity, Newton’s equations allow predicting its coordinates at future times. Let us now investigate whether the
Schrödinger equation allows this as well.
The more general solution of the Schrödinger equation can be written as a superposition of plane waves eı(r·k−ωt) with frequencies ω = p2 /2~m and wave vectors
k = p/~. Each plane wave has an individual amplitude ϕ(p), such that,

(2.19)
with h ≡ 2π~. At time t = 0, this expansion is nothing more than a Fourier transform,

(2.21)

In the absence of forces the momentum distribution becomes stationary. We can now
use the momentum distribution ϕ(p) as coefficients of the expansion of the temporal wavefunction ψ(r, t), as shown above. Thus, the expansion represents a general
solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The magnitude |ϕ(p)|2 is the
probability density in momentum space.

is easy to show that the probability density in momentum space is also normalized:

knowing that the Fourier transform of a plane wave is nothing more than the
Dirac distribution.

Since the probability distributions |ψ(r)|2 and |ϕ(p)|2 are interconnected by Fourier
transform, we already know that we can not localize 2 both simultaneously. If one is
well localized, the other is necessarily delocalized. Do the Exc. 2.1.8.2.

2.1.6

Eigenvalues

We have already seen that the position and momentum distributions of a particle are
spread. We calculate the mean values of these distributions, denoted by hri and hpi,
as first moments of the respective distributions:
Z
Z
hri = d3 r|ψ(r, t)|2 r
and
hpi = d3 p|ϕ(p, t)|2 p .

This calculation shows that the expectation value, called eigenvalue, of the momentum
can be expressed through an operator p̂ ≡ (~/ı)∇ acting on the wavefunction 3,4 .
More generally, we can compute the eigenvalue of a function in r and p via,
Z
hf (r, p)i = d3 rψ ∗ (r)f (r, p̂)ψ(r) .
(2.23)
However, it is important to note that the operators r̂ and p̂ do not necessarily commute.

Ex: Fourier theorem

The spatial distribution of a particle is given by a Gaussian function with the width

2.2

Postulates of quantum mechanics

In this section we will introduce the fundamentals and main methods of quantum
mechanics. We will learn what are observables and get to know the postulates which
establish the foundation of quantum mechanics, as well as Heisenberg’s famous principle of uncertainty.

2.2.1

Superposition principle (1. postulate)

A physical system can be found in several states. For example, a particle may be at
rest or in motion, an atom may be excited or deexcited. In quantum mechanics, every
possible state is described by a wavefunction ψ. Wavefunctions can be functions of
various types of coordinates, for example, of position ψ = ψ(r), of momentum ψ =
ψ(p), or of energy ψ = ψ(E). The choice of the coordinates is called representation.
One peculiarity of quantum systems is that they may be in a superposition of
states. That is, if ψ1 , ψ2 , ..., ψk are possible states with amplitudes ck , automatically
the functions,
Z
X
ψ=
ck ψk
or
ψ = dkc(k)φ(k)
(2.30)
k

are possible states as well. This is called superposition principle, and means, for
example, that a particle may be simultaneously in several places or that an atom may
be at the same time excited and deexcited.
There are systems that can only exist in a restricted number of states, such as
the two-level atom. Others may exist in an infinite number of states or even in a
continuous distribution of states.

2.2.2

Interpretation of the wave function (2. postulate)

A state function (or wavefunction) characterizes a system of which we may calculate
various properties. The function can adopt complex values devoid of immediate physical interpretation. In fact, the wavefunction is above all a mathematical construct.
On the other hand, the norm |ψ|2 has the meaning of a probability of the system to
be in the state ψ. This is the famous interpretation of Max Born of the wave function
(see Sec. 2.1.3).
If ψk with k = 1, 2, . . . are all possible states of a system, the interpretation as a
probability requires,
X
|ψk |2 = 1 .
(2.31)
k

Analogically, for a continuous distribution, for example, in spatial representation,
Z ∞
|ψ(x)|2 dx = 1 .
(2.32)
−∞

42

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

That is, the probability needs normalization.

2.2.3

Dirac bra-ket notation and vector representation

In order to distinguish more easily the amplitudes (which are complex numbers) and
the wavefunctions we will now use the Bra-Ket notation introduced by Paul Dirac.
The functions are represented by kets,
X
|ψi =
ck |ki .
(2.33)
k

The complex transpositions of these states are represented by bras,
X
hψ| = |ψi† =
c∗k hk| .

(2.34)

k

But the notation has other advantages. For example, let us suppose that we know
the three possible states of a system, |1i, |2i, and |3i, which are linearly independent.
Then we can define the states as vectors:
 
 
 
1
0
0





|1i = 0
,
|2i = 1
,
|3i = 0 .
(2.35)
0
0
1

These three states can be interpreted as the basis of a vector space representing the
system. Now, each wavefunction can be expanded on this basis and expressed by a
vector. An arbitrary ket state of this system will then be,
 
c1
|ψi = c2  .
(2.36)
c3
The corresponding bra state will be,

hψ| = c∗1

c∗2

Now we can easily calculate the probability for a system to be in a state |ψi,

(2.38)

Observables (3. postulate)

The only way to get information about a system is to measure the values of characteristic quantities of the system, e.g. energy or linear momentum. In classical mechanics
we have learned that a system can be completely characterized by a set of measurable
physical quantities. For example, the motion of a rigid body of mass m and inertial
moment I is defined by its position r, its moment p, and its angular momentum L. In
quantum mechanics we describe observable physical quantities by operators acting on

2.2. POSTULATES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

43

the Hilbert space of wavefunctions, |ψi 7→ p̂|ψi, where p̂ would be the operator of the
linear momentum. To better distinguish the observables, we decorate their symbols
with a hat. We will see more ahead (see Sec. 2.3.5) that every quantum system is
completely described by a complete set of observables.
To find the current values aψ of any observable Â in a specific situation given by
a wave function ψ, we need to solve an equation of eigenvalues,
Â|ψi = aψ |ψi .

(2.39)

We can rewrite the equation as aψ = hψ|Â|ψi. The values an are real numbers, if the
observable is a Hermitian operator, that is,
Â = Â† =⇒ aψ = a∗ψ .

(2.40)

We leave proof of this for the Exc. 2.2.9.1.
Thus, we postulate the substitution of the dynamic variables characterizing a classical system by abstract objects called operators. These operators can be understood
as mathematical prescriptions, e.g., differential operators acting on a state of the
system. The expectation value of any operator Â characterizing a system in a state
|ψi is aψ ≡ hÂiψ ≡ hψ|Â|ψi/hψ|ψi. Such operators are specific for a system, but
independent of its state. The dynamical variables for a specific state are obtained as
eigenvalues of the respective variable in that specific state. The temporal evolution
of the operators or of the states is governed by equations of motion (see Sec. 2.4) 5 .

2.2.5

Representation of operators as matrices

In the same way as we already represented wavefunctions by vectors, we can also
represent operators by matrices,

Â ≡

X
i,j



|iiaij hj| = ..



5 Note that there are theoretical attempts to generalize the concept of observables to nonHermitian operators [50, 51] only displaying PT -symmetry.

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

The eigenvalue of a projector, hP̂k i = hψ|P̂k |ψi = |hk|ψi|2 , is nothing more than the
probability of finding a system, whose general state is |ψi, in the particular state,

The representation of physical quantities by matrices allows the description of
quantum superposition states. The purpose of Exc. 2.2.9.3 is to illustrate this at the
example of a particle passing through a double slit.

2.2.6

Correspondence principle (4. postulate)

Operators do not necessarily commute. We have already seen in Sec. 2.1.6, that in
one dimension the position and the momentum operators do not commute. We can
generalize to three dimensions via,
[p̂j , x̂k ] = −ı~δjk
6 The

and

[p̂j , p̂k ] = 0 = [x̂j , x̂k ] ,

(2.49)

Bloch vector is widely used in describing the interaction of a two-level system with a light
field.
7 Schrödinger invented the wave mechanics when he derived his wave equation from the dispersion
relation for massive particles. Heisenberg invented a mechanics (detailed in later sections), which he
called mechanics of matrices. Later, he showed the formal equivalence of both theories.

2.2. POSTULATES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

which is easily verified by replacing the operators with x̂k = xk and p̂k = ~ı ∇ and
allowing the commutators to act on a wavefunction ψ(x).
Conversely, quantum mechanics follows from classical mechanics with the prescription 8 , A(qk , pk , t) −→ A(q̂k , p̂k , t) = Â. Letting the smallest amount of energy
possible go to zero, ~ −→ 0, the commutator disappears, the energy spectrum becomes
continuous, and we recover classical mechanics.

2.2.7

Schrödinger equation and quantum measurements (5.
postulate)

The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation,
ı~

∂
|ψi = Ĥ|ψi .
∂t

(2.50)

A closed system, disconnected from the rest of the world (we will now call the
rest of the world reservoir) is not subject to dissipation, i.e., it does not lose energy
to the reservoir. Such a system is always described by a hermitian Hamiltonian.
Unfortunately, this system also does not allow information leakage, that is, we can
not measure the system. This is reflected in the fact that the Schrödinger equation
does not allow to describe the process of a quantum measurement. This is because
before the measurement, the system can be in several states or even in a superposition
of states, while after the measurement we know exactly the state. This amounts to a
reduction of entropy, which is not allowed in a closed system.
The famous postulate of state reduction or projection of the wavefunction formulated by John von Neumann describes the quantum measurement process as a
sequence of two distinct steps 9 . In a first step, the measuring apparatus projects
the measured operator Â on an eigenvector basis. That is, if the measurement is
compatible with the operator 10 , we obtain a distribution of probability amplitudes
of the results,

with hψ|ψi = k |ak | = 1. Therefore, we can understand |hk|ψi| as the probability
of the system to be in the eigenstate |ki. In other words, this first step of the measurement P
process removes in an irreversible manner all coherences from the observable,

In a second step, the observing scientist will read the measuring device and note
the result, which will necessarily be one of the possible ak ,

(2.52)

If the state is stationary, it will never change any more. That is, each subsequent
measurement will yield the same result. The Exc. 2.2.9.4 illustrates the process of
quantum measurement at the example of a measurement of the excitation energy of
a two-level atom.

Abstract formalism of quantum mechanics
(b)

The formal development of quantum mechanics will be the subject of this section. We
will learn how to find a complete set of observables characterizing a system, discuss
the role of symmetries in quantum mechanics and show how to switch between several
representations of the same system.

2.3.1

Lie algebra

The quantum mechanical operators form a Lie algebra L2 . This means that L2 is
at the same time a complex and linear vector space with respect to addition and
scalar multiplication and a non-commutative ring with scalar internal product. In
particular, L2 is unitary, normalized, and complete and acts on a Hilbert space of
quantum states,
(Â + B̂)|ψi = Â|ψi + B̂|ψi,

(2.57)

(αÂ)|ψi = α(Â|ψi) ,
(ÂB̂)|ψi = Â(B̂|ψi) .
The properties of the Hilbert space are,
Â|ψ + ϕi = Â|ψi + Â|ϕi ,

(2.58)

Â|aψi = aÂ|ψi .
For a Hermitian operator, Â = Â† , we have hψ|Â|ψi = hÂψ|ψi or hÂi ≡ hψ|Â|ψi =
hÂi∗ , using the Dirac bra-ket notation,
hψ|† ≡ |ψi .

(2.59)

There are identity and nullity operators,
1̂|ψi = |ψi

and

0̂|ψi = 0 .

(2.60)

We define the (anti-)commutator as,
[Â, B̂]∓ ≡ ÂB̂ ± B̂ Â ,

(2.61)

which can be 6= 0. The sum of two Hermitian operators is Hermitian, but the product
is not, since,
(Â + B̂)† = Â† + B̂ † = Â + B̂

but

(ÂB̂)† = B̂ † Â† = B̂ Â 6= ÂB̂ .

(2.62)

2.3. ABSTRACT FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

49

On the other hand, the following relations of Hermitian operators are always Hermitian,
ÂB̂ + B̂ Â
and
ı(ÂB̂ − B̂ Â) .
(2.63)
We define the scalar product as,
hψ|ϕi .

(2.64)

Two states are called orthogonal, if hψ|ϕi = 0. The norm is written as,
|ψ|2 = hψ|ψi ,
the deviation is,
∆A ≡

q

(2.65)

hÂ2 i − hÂi2 .

(2.66)

A unitary operator is defined by Â−1 = Â† .

2.3.2

Complete bases

If it is impossible to find a set of amplitudes cn ,
X
@{cn } such that
cn |ni = 0 ,

(2.67)

n

the functions are called linearly independent. A set of linearly independent functions
may form a basis. The space opened by a set of linearly independent functions is
called Hilbert space.
An operator Â is completely characterized by its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
If a set of eigenfunctions |ni is complete, every allowed state of the system can be
expanded in these eigenfunctions,
X
|ψi =
cn |ni
and
Â|ni = an |ni .
(2.68)
n

To calculate properties of a specific system, we often want to find a matrix representation for the operator Â. For this, we solve the stationary Schrödinger equation,
that is, we calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. When all eigenvalues are different, an 6= am , we know that the corresponding eigenvectors are orthogonal, hn|mi = 0,
Â|ni = an |ni

,

Â|mi = an |mi

=⇒ ∀{n, m} hn|mi = δm,n .

,

∀{n, m} an 6= am

(2.69)

Exc. 2.3.9.1 asks for demonstrating this.
Frequently, for example, in the case of a particle confined to a potential, there
exist discrete eigenvalues (for E < 0) simultaneously with continuous eigenvalues (for
E > 0). Assuming hm|m0 i = δm,m0 , hm|ki = 0 and hk|k0 i = δ (3) (k − k0 ), with a
complete base,

an arbitrary vector can be expanded on an orthogonal basis,

2.3.3

Degeneracy

The eigenvectors form a natural basis for the Hilbert space. However, a problem arises
in the case of degeneracy, that is, when some eigenvalues are equal, an = am . In this
case, the eigenvectors that correspond to degenerate eigenvalues are not completely
defined, and we have to construct a basis verifying that all constructed eigenvectors are
orthogonal. For this, there exists the method of orthogonalization by Schmidt, which
works like this: We assume that we have already solved the eigenvalue equation, that
we found a degenerate eigenvalue, Â|ak i = a|ak i for every k = 1, .., gk , where gk is
the degree of degeneracy, and that we also found a complete basis of eigenvalues |am i,
but which is not orthogonal, that is, ∃{m, n} with han |am i 6= 0. The task is to build
another basis |bm i satisfying hbn |bm i = δn,m .
The first vector of the orthogonal base can be chosen freely, e.g.,
|b1 i ≡ |a1 i .

(2.74)

Since the basis {|ak i} is assumed to be complete, the second vector is necessarily a
linear combination of vectors |ak i, that is, |b2 i = |a2 i + λ|b1 i. With the condition
hb1 |b2 i = 0 = hb1 |a2 i + λhb1 |b1 i we can determine the parameter λ, and obtain for the
second vector,
hb1 |a2 i
|b2 i ≡ |a2 i − |b1 i
.
(2.75)
hb1 |b1 i

In the same way, we can derive for a third vector, |b3 i = |a3 i + µ|b1 i + ν|b2 i, the
conditions, hb1 |b3 i = 0 = hb1 |a3 i + µhb1 |b1 i and hb2 |b3 i = 0 = hb2 |a3 i + νhb2 |b2 i, and
obtain,
hb1 |a3 i
hb2 |a3 i
|b3 i ≡ |a3 i − |b1 i
− |b2 i
.
(2.76)
hb1 |b1 i
hb2 |b2 i
An overall way of writing this down is,

|b1 ihb1 | |b2 ihb2 |
|bk−1 ihbk−1 |
|bk i ≡ 1 −
−
− ... −
|ak i .
hb1 |b1 i
hb2 |b2 i
hbk−1 |bk−1 i

(2.77)

In the Exc. 2.3.9.2 we practice the orthogonalization of a set of three linearly independent but non-orthogonal vectors, and in the Exc. 2.3.9.3 we find an orthogonal
basis for a partially degenerate three-level system.

2.3. ABSTRACT FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

Bases as unitary operators

One way to formulate the eigenvalue problem is as follows: Let |ni be an orthonormal
basis with the respective eigenvalues an of an operator Â:
Â|ni = an |ni

with

hn|mi = δmn .

(2.78)

We construct the matrices,

U ≡ |1i

|2i

and



Ê ≡ 

(2.80)

U † = U −1

(2.81)

Therefore,
U † U = 1̂

U U = 1̂

=⇒
=⇒

U † U U −1 = 1̂U −1
†

=⇒

−1

=⇒

†

U U = 1̂ .

Also,
Â|ni = Ê|ni

and

ÂU = U Ê .

(2.82)

That is, by knowing the unitary matrix (or transformation matrix) U , we can solve
the eigenvalue problem simply by Ê = U −1 ÂU .
Note, that this does not apply to a non-orthonormal basis. In this case, we need
to do a Schmidt orthogonalization and use the condition det U = 1. We apply the
technique detailed in this section to solve Excs. 2.3.9.4, 2.3.9.5, and 2.3.9.6.

2.3.5

Complete set of commuting operators

Even for simple systems, we can ask various types of questions (measurements). Considering, for example, a particle flying freely in space, we can gather its position
or its velocity. Let a be the result of a measurement of the observable Â, that is,
a = hψa |Â|ψa i. Due to the measurement we know that the system is in the state
|ψa i. Immediately after this first measurement we perform another measurement of
another observable B̂ giving hψa |B̂|ψa i. The result of this measurement can only
yield an eigenstate, b = hψa |B̂|ψa i, if the operators commute, [Â, B̂] = 0. That is, if
two operators Â and B̂ commute, and if |ψi is an eigenvector of Â, then B̂|ψi is also
an eigenvector of Â with the same eigenvalue:
[Â, B̂] = 0

,

a = hψ|Â|ψi

=⇒ Â(B̂|ψi) = a(B̂|ψi)

and

hψ|B̂|ψi ∈ R .

(2.83)

52

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

In addition, we observe that, if two operators commute, the orthonormal basis
constructed for one of the operators is also orthonormal for the other. That is, if
two operators Â and B̂ commute and if |ψ1 i and |ψ2 i are two eigenvectors of Â with
different eigenvalues, then the matrix element hψ1 |B̂|ψ2 i is equal to zero:
[Â, B̂] = 0

a1 = hψ1 |Â|ψ1 i =
6 hψ2 |Â|ψ2 i = a2

,

=⇒ hψ1 |B̂|ψ2 i = 0 .

(2.84)

Finally, we affirm that, if two operators Â and B̂ commute, we can construct an
orthonormal basis {|ψa,b i} with common eigenvectors of Â and B̂:
[Â, B̂] = 0
=⇒ ∃ {|ψa,b i}

(2.85)
tal que

Â|ψa,b i = a|ψa,b i

and

B̂|ψa,b i = b|ψa,b i .

The statements (2.83) to (2.85) are verified in Exc. 2.3.9.7.
The fact that commuting operators have a common system of eigenvectors authorizing sharp eigenvalues can be used to construct and characterize a state.
Example 5 (Measuring momenta in orthogonal directions): For example,
the obvious solutions of the eigenvalue equations,
p̂x |ψpx i =

~ d
|ψpx i = px |ψpx i
ı dx

and

p̂y |ψpy i =

~ d
|ψpy i = py |ψpy i
ı dy

are the plane waves eıpx x/~ and eıpy y/~ . Therefore, the total state of the particle
can be described by,
|ψpx ,py ,pz i = |ψpx i|ψpy i = e(ı/~)(px x+py y) f (z) .
However, these eigenfunctions are infinitely degenerate, since the linear momentum in z-direction is not specified. A third operator p̂z |ψi = pz |ψi commutes
with the others,
[p̂k , p̂m ] = 0 .
Hence,
|ψpx ,py ,pz i = e(ı/~)(px x+py y+pz z) ,

is a possible state of the system.
∂2
On the other hand, choosing p̂2z = −~2 ∂z
2 as the third operator, giving the
2
eigenvalues pz , the state would have been,
|ψpx ,py ,p2z i = e(ı/~)(px x+py y) cos

|ψpx ,py ,p2z i = e(ı/~)(px x+py y) sin pz~z .
(2.86)
Therefore, there are two solutions with the same eigenvalues, px , py , p2z . To lift
this degeneracy, we need to introduce yet another observable. This observable
can be, for example, the parity P̂ , that is, the behavior of the wave function
upon mirroring z −→ −z in the x-y plane. The fact that the set of operators
px , py , pz on one hand and px , py , p2z , P̂ on the other are equivalent, shows that
the required number of observables for a complete characterization depends on
their judicious choice.

or

2.3. ABSTRACT FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

Also, the number needed for a complete set of commuting operators (CSCO) depends on the number of degrees of freedom and the symmetry of the system. In the
case of the free particle in one dimension it is enough to consider one observable only,
for example, x̂ or p̂. In three dimensions, we already need at least three commuting
observables. In Exc. 2.3.9.8 we will try to find a CSCO for a matrix with partially
degenerate eigenvalues.

2.3.6

Uncertainty relation

We have already learned that observables that do not commute can not be measured
with arbitrary precision. This principle can be quantified as follows: If Â and B̂ are
two observables, then,
(2.87)
∆Â∆B̂ ≥ 12 |h[Â, B̂]i| .

This is Heisenberg’s famous uncertainty principle. For example, [p̂, x̂] = −ı~, and
hence, ∆p∆x ≥ ~/2. We will see later (see Sec. 4.3.1), that [ˆlx , ˆly ] = ı~ˆlz such that
∆lx ∆ly ≥ ~hlz i/2. More difficult to show, since time has no simple quantum operator,
is ∆E∆t ≥ ~/2. In the Exc. 2.3.9.9 we will show the Schwartz inequality, and in the
Exc. 2.3.9.10 we ask for a formal derivation of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

2.3.7

Representations

2.3.7.1

Spatial representation

A Hilbert space can be discrete or, as in the case of the momentum of a free particle,
continuous. In this latter case, the eigenvalues are continuously distributed, since the
equation,
−ı~∇r ψ(r) = pψ(r) ,
(2.88)

has solutions for each value of E. The eigenfunctions are ψ(r) = aeıp·r/~ . Eq. (2.88)
clearly has the form of an eigenvalue equation, for which we have already introduced
the Heisenberg matrix formalism. The question now is how these descriptions combine.

Observables that do not commute correspond to expansions on different bases
and generate alternative representations. For example, we can represent quantum
mechanics in position space or linear momentum space. If |ri is a basis of the space
of the particles’ state,

and any state vector as,

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

The quantities hr|ψ(t)i = ψ(t, r) Schrödinger wave functions. We can also say that the
wavefunctions are the coordinates of the state in the particular base |ri. Consequently,
hr|r̂|r0 i = rδ 3 (r − r0 )
0

hr|f (r̂)|r i = f (r)δ (r − r ) .

(2.93)

R3

where the quantity A(r, r0 ) ≡ hr|Â|r0 i is called kernel of the operator. The transition
from Heisenberg’s abstract mechanics to Schrödinger’s wave mechanics is done by the
substitutions |ψ(t)i → ψ(t, r) and Â → A(r, r0 ).
2.3.7.2

Momentum representation

The uncertainty relation is symmetric in r̂ and p̂. Nothing prevents us from choosing
as a basis,

|piϕ(p, t)d3 p ,

(2.96)

where hp|ψ(t)i = ϕ(t, p). The formulas are analogous to the ones in the spatial
representation. In particular, in the momentum representation the position operator
is r = ı~∇p .
The representations follow from one another by Fourier transformation. Since
−ı~∇r hr|pi = phr|pi, we know,
hr|pi =

[r−3/2 ] and [|pi] = [ϕ(p)] = [p−3/2 ]. We do not assign a unit to the abstract state |ψi, that is,
[|ψi] = 1.

can understand an operator as a rule to determine what happens to a function. For
example, the rule p̂x asks for a derivation of the wavefunction by x.

2.3.8

Spanning a Hilbert space with several degrees of freedom

All systems analyzed up to this point were characterized by a single degree of freedom
(e.g., energy, momentum, or angular momentum), which could have a continuous
or discrete spectrum. Even when we treated systems exhibiting various degrees of
freedom (motion of a particle in 3D space, electron orbitals in the hydrogen atom),
we always found a way to separate the degrees of freedom into orthogonal Hilbert
spaces, which allowed us to treat the dynamics of the degrees of freedom separately.
In this chapter, we will establish the theoretical foundations allowing us to analyze
systems, where degrees of freedom can not be separated because they are entangled
or interact. In particular, we will consider the system of two spins and the coupling
of angular momenta in general.

Projection and internal sum

A projector is an operator which reduces the domain of an operator, originally acting
on a Hilbert space H to the subspace defined by the projector. We consider an operator
Â with the matrix representation,

Obviously, the concatenation (2.106) only serves to increase the Hilbert space of
a given degree of freedom described by a given observable, e.g., when we add one
more level of energy to the spectrum of an atom described by a Hamiltonian. If, in
contrast, we want to add another degree of freedom, we need the external sum or
external product discussed below.
2.3.8.2

Tensorial product

We have previously worked with systems exhibiting more than one degree of freedom
and therefore having to be characterized by more than one observable with its spectrum of eigenstates. One example are the electronic orbitals of the hydrogen atom
|n`mi, which need three quantum numbers to be labeled unambiguously. Obviously,
each quantum number increases the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. Another
example is the system |αβi of two particles with spin 12 , each spin being defined on
its respective space,
|αi =

The symbol ⊗ denotes the outer tensorial product of two vectors (states) 12 . Now, in
order to represent the multidimensional space HA ⊗ HB by a matrix, we use the fact
that it is isomorphic to the space HI ⊗ HA⊗B , that is, we proceed to a reorganization

The concept (2.111) can be generalized to more degrees of freedom like,
X
Â ⊗ B̂ ⊗ Ĉ ≡
|ikmiAij Bkl Cmn hjln| ,
(2.114)
(ikm)(jln)

Obviously, the external product is associative (Â ⊗ B̂) ⊗ C = Â ⊗ (B̂ ⊗ C), but
does not commute, even though the operators acting on different spaces do commute,
[Â, B̂] = 0. Nevertheless, we can reverse the order of the product of two operators
using,

We note, that it is important to distinguish from what space the vector came
from. In our notation, the vector before the symbol of the tensorial product (⊗) is
belongs to the space HA , and the one after the ⊗ belongs to the space HB . With the
definition (2.110) we can verify that the operators only act on their respective states:
(A ⊗ B)(|αi ⊗ |βi) = A|αi ⊗ B|βi .

Example 8 (Mathematical definition of the tensor product): If α belongs
to the Hilbert space Hα and β belongs to Hβ , then the equivalence class of (α, β)
is denoted by α⊗β and called the tensor product of α with β. This use of the ⊗symbol refers specifically to the outer product operation. An element of Hα ⊗Hβ
that can be written in the form α ⊗ β is called a pure tensor. In general, an
element of the tensor product space is not a pure tensor, but rather a finite linear

60

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS
combination of pure tensors. For example, if α1 and α2 are linearly independent,
and β1 and β2 are also linearly independent, then α1 ⊗ β1 + α2 ⊗ β2 cannot be
written as a pure tensor. The number of pure tensors required to express an
element of a tensor product is called the tensor rank. The rank should not be
confused with the tensor order, which is the number of spaces one has taken the
product of (in this case two), and which corresponds to the number of indices.
For linear operators or matrices, thought of as (1, 1) tensors (elements of the
∗
space Hα ⊗ Hα
), the tensor rank agrees with matrix rank.
Given bases {αi } and {βj } for Hα and Hβ respectively, the tensors {αi ⊗ βj }
form a basis for Hα ⊗ Hβ . Therefore, if Hα and Hβ are finite-dimensional, the
dimension of the tensor product is the product of dimensions of the original
spaces; for instance Rm ⊗ Rn is isomorphic to Rnm .
The tensor product also operates on linear maps (called operators in quantum
mechanics) between vector spaces. Specifically, given two linear maps Â : Hα →
0
Hα
and B̂ : Hβ → Hβ0 between vector spaces, the tensor product of the two
linear maps Â and B̂ is a linear map,
0
Â ⊗ B̂ : Hα ⊗ Hβ → Hα
⊗ Hβ0 ,

defined by,
(Â ⊗ B̂)(α ⊗ β) = Â(α) ⊗ B̂(β) .
In this way, the tensor product becomes a bifunctor from the category of vector
spaces to itself, covariant in both arguments. If Â and B̂ are both injective,
0
surjective or (in the case that Hα , Hα
, Hβ , and Hβ0 are normed vector spaces
or topological vector spaces) continuous, then Â ⊗B̂ is injective, surjective or
continuous, respectively.
By choosing bases of all vector spaces involved, the linear maps Â and B̂ can be
represented by matrices. Then, depending on how the tensor α⊗β is vectorized,
the matrix describing the tensor product Â ⊗B̂ is the Kronecker product of
0
the two matrices. For example, if Hα , Hα
, Hβ , and Hβ0 above are all twodimensional and bases have been fixed for all of them, and Â and B̂ are given
by the matrices,
Â =

A11
A21

,

B̂ =

respectively, then the tensor product of these two matrices is,

The resultant rank is at most 4, and thus the resultant dimension is 4. Note that
rank here denotes the tensor rank i.e. the number of requisite indices (while the
matrix rank counts the number of degrees of freedom in the resulting array).
Note Tr Â ⊗ B̂ = Tr Â × Tr B̂.
A dyadic product is the special case of the tensor product between two vectors
of the same dimension.

Consider two spins a and b that do not interact. Applying to each spin the same
transformation to another base, show that the singlet state has in each base the
following form: |ψi = √12 (| ↑ia | ↓ib − | ↓ia | ↑ib ).

2.4

Time evolutions

Quantum systems may evolve in time, as predicted by the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation (2.50). In this section we show different equivalent but complementary
descriptions of the temporal evolution of quantum systems depending on whether the
time dependence is attributed to the state function of to observables.

2.4.1

Unitary transformations

The best we can do to characterize a system is, obviously, to measure all its observables. However, neither the state functions nor the observables are fixed unambiguously, since defining a unitary operator, U † = U −1 , we can do,
hψ|Â|ψi = hψ|U † U ÂU † U |ψi = hU ψ|U ÂU † |U ψi .

(2.124)

That is, exchanging |ψi by U |ψi and at the same time Â by U ÂU † , we obtain quantities describing the same physical reality, since the eigenvalues are unchanged. This
allows us to choose the best mathematical representation for a specific problem. As
an example, we will apply the temporal unitary transformation to solve the dynamics
of a coupled two-level system in Exc. 2.4.7.1.

2.4.2

Schrödinger picture

Important examples of how the same system can be represented in different ways
(related by unitary transformations) are the Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and interaction
pictures.
The Schrödinger picture, denoted by the subscript S, is defined by the choice of a
Hamiltonian,
d

ĤS = Ĥ(t, p̂S , r̂S )
with
p̂S = r̂S = 0 .

2.4. TIME EVOLUTIONS

That is, the observables of the system ÂS (t, p̂S , r̂S ) can only depend explicitly on
time, but not via the operators p̂S and r̂S , which are stationary,

.

(2.126)

This is,
d
∂
ÂS (t) = ÂS (t) .
dt
∂t

(2.127)

In this case, the formal solution of the Schrödinger equation,
ı~

d
|ψS (t)i = ĤS |ψS (t)i ,
dt

(2.128)

can be written,
|ψS (t)i = e−(ı/~)ĤS t |ψS (0)i ≡ U (t)|ψS (0)i .

(2.129)

Apparently, the temporal dynamics is completely within the wave functions.
Example 10 (The time evolution operator ): Generalizing to an arbitrary
initial time t0 we write the temporal translation operator,
U (t, t0 )|ψ(t0 )i = |ψ(t)i .

(2.130)

By the expression (2.129) we find immediately, with t0 < t1 < t2 ,
U (t2 , t0 ) = U (t2 , t1 )U (t1 , t0 )

and

U (t0 , t) = U † (t, t0 ) = U −1 (t, t0 ) = U (t, t0 )−1 .

The conjugate operator of time evolution acts on the vector ’bra’,
hψ(t)| = hψ(t0 )|U † (t, t0 ) .

2.4.3

Heisenberg picture

As unitary transformations do not change the physics, the system described by,
|ψS (t)i −→ U (t)† |ψS (t)i ≡ |ψH i

ÂS (t) −→ U (t)† ÂS (t)U (t) ≡ ÂH (t)
(2.131)
with the transformation defined by equation (2.129), is equivalent. The subscript H
means the Heisenberg picture. In particular, we obviously have,
and

ĤS = ĤH ≡ Ĥ .

(2.132)

Thus, the matrix element of the operator ÂS in Schrödinger’s picture with the timedependent base {|ψS i} is equal to the matrix element of the operator ÂH = U † ÂS U
in Heisenberg’s picture with the time-independent base {|ψH i}. In this picture the
wavefunctions are independent of time,

(2.135)

This so-called Heisenberg equation, which describes the temporal evolution of an operator acting on time-independent states in the Heisenberg picture, is equivalent to
the Schrödinger equation, which expresses the temporal evolution of a quantum state
in Schrödinger’s picture.
According to equation (2.135), the rate of temporal variation of an operator in
the Heisenberg representation is given by the commutator of that operator with the
total Hamiltonian of the system. Note that if an operator representing a dynamic
variable commutes with the Hamiltonian in the Schrödinger representation, it will
also commute with the Hamiltonian in the Heisenberg representation and thus with
the complete set of commutating observables,
[Ĥ, ÂS ] = 0

⇐⇒

[Ĥ, ÂH ] = 0 .

(2.136)

We will show this in the Exc. 2.4.7.2.
Example 11 (Position and momentum operators in the Heisenberg picture): We know that in Schrödinger’s picture (2.125), the operators p̂S and r̂S
are stationary. Using this fact in derivation (2.134), we can show for example
for the momentum operator,
∂
p̂S = 0

∂

~

In the Exc. 2.4.7.3 we will use the Heisenberg picture to derive the equations of
motion for a particle confined to a potential.

2.4.4

Interaction picture

The interaction picture deals with problems where the total Hamiltonian is composed
of a time-independent part and a time-dependent part,
Ĥ = Ĥ0 + V̂ (t) .

(2.137)

Analogously to Eq. (2.129), we define a time evolution operator in terms of the timeindependent part of the total Hamiltonian,
|ψI (t)i = eıĤ0 t/~ |ψS (t)i

and

ÂI (t) = eıĤ0 t/~ ÂS e−ıĤ0 t/~ .

(2.138)

2.4. TIME EVOLUTIONS

67

Now we are interested in the temporal dependence of quantum states and operators
in the interaction picture. Replacing the inverse function |ψS (t)i = e−ıĤ0 t/~ |ψI (t)i
in the Schrödinger equation (2.128) we immediately see,
V̂ (t)|ψI (t)i = ı~

∂
|ψI (t)i .
∂t

(2.139)

Apparently, in the interaction picture, only the perturbative term in Hamiltonian
controls the temporal evolution. Taking the time derivative of both sides of the
equation (2.138) transforming an operator from the Schrödinger to the interaction
picture results in,
ı
∂ ÂI
dÂI
= [Ĥ0 , ÂI ] +
.
dt
~
∂t

(2.140)

Therefore, we see that the time derivative can be expressed in the form of a commutator, resembling the Heisenberg equation (2.135), except that only the unperturbed
term of the Hamiltonian appears in the argument of the commutation operator.
Example 12 (Schrieffer-Wolff transformation): The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is a unitary transformation used to perturbatively diagonalize the system Hamiltonian to first order in the interaction. As such, the Schrieffer-Wolff
transformation is an operator version of second-order perturbation theory. The
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is often used to project out the high energy excitations of a given quantum many-body Hamiltonian in order to obtain an
effective low energy model. The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation thus provides
a controlled perturbative way to study the strong coupling regime of quantummany body Hamiltonians.
Consider a quantum system evolving under the time-independent Hamiltonian
operator Ĥ of the form Ĥ = Ĥ0 + V̂ , where H0 is a Hamiltonian with known
eigenstates |mi and corresponding eigenvalues Em , and where V is a small perturbation. Moreover, it is assumed without loss of generality that V̂ is purely
off-diagonal in the eigenbasis of Ĥ0 , i.e.,
hm|V̂ |mi = 0

(2.141)

for all m. Indeed, this situation can always be arranged by absorbing the diagonal elements of V̂ into Ĥ0 , thus modifying its eigenvalues to,
0
Em
= Em + hm|V̂ |mi .

(2.142)

The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is a unitary transformation which expresses
the Hamiltonian in a basis (the ’dressed’ basis) where it is diagonal to first order
in the perturbation V̂ . This unitary transformation is conventionally written
as:
Ĥ 0 = eıS Ĥe−ıS .
(2.143)
When V̂ is small, the generator S of the transformation will likewise be small.
The transformation can then be expanded in S using the Baker-CampbellHaussdorf formula,
Ĥ 0 = Ĥ + [ıS, Ĥ] + 21 [ıS, [ıS, Ĥ]] + . . . .

(2.144)

68

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS
In terms of Ĥ0 and V̂ , the transformation becomes,
Ĥ 0 = Ĥ0 + V̂ + [ıS, Ĥ0 ] + [ıS, V̂ ] + 12 [ıS, [ıS, Ĥ0 ]] + 21 [ıS, [ıS, V̂ ]] + . . . . (2.145)
The Hamiltonian can be made diagonal to first order in V̂ by choosing the
generator S such that,
[Ĥ0 , ıS] = V̂ .
(2.146)
This equation always has a definite solution under the assumption that V̂ is
off-diagonal in the eigenbasis of Ĥ0 . Substituting this choice in the previous
transformation yields:
Ĥ 0 = Ĥ0 + 12 [ıS, V̂ ] + O(V̂ 3 ) .

(2.147)

This expression is the standard form of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. Note
that all the operators on the right-hand side are now expressed in a new basis
’dressed’ by the interaction V̂ to first order.
In the general case, the difficult step of the transformation is to find an explicit
expression for the generator S. Once this is done, it is straightforward to compute the Schrieffer-Wolff Hamiltonian by computing the commutator [S, V̂ ]. The
Hamiltonian can then be projected on any subspace of interest to obtain an effective projected Hamiltonian for that subspace. In order for the transformation
to be accurate, the eliminated subspaces must be energetically well separated
from the subspace of interest, meaning that the strength of the interaction V̂
must be much smaller than the energy difference between the subspaces. This
is the same regime of validity as in standard second-order perturbation theory.

2.4.5

Hamiltonian under arbitrary unitary transformation

In the preceding section we have studied particular unitary transformations between
the Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and interaction pictures. Let us now have a look at
arbitrary unitary transformations.
We have seen that the unitary transformation,
|ψU i = U † |ψi

,

ÂU = U † ÂU ,

(2.148)

leaves the physics of a system unchanged. The question is now, how the Schrödinger
equation,
d
Ĥ|ψi = ı~ |ψi
(2.149)
dt
transforms into the new system, that is, what will the Hamiltonian Ĥ 0 look like in
the transformed equation,
d
?
Ĥ 0 |ψU i = ı~ |ψU i .
(2.150)
dt
We calculate,

Hence,
Ĥ 0 = U † ĤU + ı~U̇ † U .

(2.152)

2.4. TIME EVOLUTIONS

69

Example 13 (Interaction picture): The above derivation is general and
holds for any unitary transformation. We will now apply it to transform the
Hamiltonian Ĥ = Ĥ0 + V̂ (t) into the interaction picture via the transformation
U = e−(ı/~)Ĥ0 t . From
U̇ † =

~
h
i
= U † Ĥ0 + V̂ (t) U − Ĥ0 = U † V̂ (t)U ,

(2.154)

which confirms the validity of the Schrödinger equation (2.139) in the interaction
picture, provided the Hamiltonian is taken to be the perturbation part V̂ (t),
only. In the Heisenberg picture V̂ (t) = 0, such that,
Ĥ 0 = 0 .

2.4.6

(2.155)

Ehrenfest’s theorem

For linear operators satisfying [Â, B̂] = ı we can give a generalization of the commutation relation:
δF (Â, B̂)
[Â, F (Â, B̂)] = ı
.
(2.156)
δ B̂
This can be verified by a Taylor expansion of F (Â, B̂) by B̂ around B̂ = 0, as will be
shown in Exc. 2.4.7.4. An immediate consequence of [p̂, r̂] = −ı~ is,
[p̂, F (r̂)] = −ı~

δF (r̂)
.
δr̂

(2.157)

The momentum observable is not singularly defined by the commutation relation, because each unitarily transformed operator satisfies the relation as well. We
can expand a unitarily equivalent momentum as p̃ = U pU † = eıF (r) pe−ıF (r) =
1
p + ı[F (r), p] + 2!
[F (r), [F (r), p]] + ... using the relation (2.157).
The observables in the Heisenberg picture follow the same equations of motion as
the corresponding classical quantities. This correspondence principle is called Ehrenfest theorem. For example, when working with position and momentum variables
~2 2
[r̂, k̂] = ı and Ĥ = 2m
k̂ + V (r̂), we obtain,
[r̂, Ĥ] = ı~

δ Ĥ

[p̂, Ĥ] = −ı~

(2.158)

and using the Heisenberg equation (2.135),

and

(2.159)

We will demonstrate this in Exc. 2.4.7.5 for the case of a harmonic potential.

hÂS i = h∂t ψ|ÂS |ψi + hψ|∂t ÂS |ψi + hψ|ÂS |∂t ψi = hÂS i + h[Ĥ, ÂS ]i . (2.160)

The eigenvalues behave as Heisenberg observables in Eq. (2.134), that is, they follow
the laws of Hamilton’s and Newton’s mechanics.

Symmetries in quantum mechanics

We already saw in Sec. 2.3.4 that, beyond observables, there is another category of
operators that does not correspond to measurable physical quantities, but is very
useful in the quantum formalism. These are the unitary transformations. In this
section we will encounter some interesting examples.

2.5.1

Translation and rotation

2.5.1.1

Temporal translation operator

The temporal evolution of a system is described by the Schrödinger equation whose
formal solution can be written as follows,
|ψ(t)i = e−ıĤt/~ |ψ(0)i .

(2.161)

With this we can define an evolution operator or temporal translation,
Utp (τ ) ≡ e−ıĤt/~

such that

Utp (τ )|ψ(t)i = |ψ(t + τ )i .

(2.162)

The temporal evolution has already been discussed extensively in Sec. 2.4.
2.5.1.2

Spatial translation operator

In this section we look for a unitary translation operator,
Ttr r ≡ a + r .

(2.163)

Before this, we need to derive the following calculation rule for commutators, which
will be done in Exc. 2.5.5.1:
eÂ B̂e−Â = B̂ + [Â, B̂] +

1
2! [Â, [Â, B̂]]

+ ... .

(2.164)

Applying this formula to the two operators p̂ and r̂ related by the commutation
rule (2.49), we obtain,
e(ı/~)a·p̂ r̂e(−ı/~)a·p̂ = r̂ + [(ı/~)a · p̂, r̂] +

1
2!

[(ı/~)a · p̂, a]

0

+ ... = r̂ + a .

(2.165)

That is, the operator
Utr (a) ≡ e(−ı/~)a·p̂

(2.166)

performs a spatial translation of the position operator. The operator is unitary,
Utr (a)−1 = Utr (a)† ,

(2.167)

and forms a group since Utr (a)Utr (b) = Utr (a + b). Summarizing the impact of the
translation on the operators of space,
†
Utr
(a)r̂Utr (a) = r̂ + a

,

†
Utr
(a)p̂Utr (a) = p̂ ,

(2.168)

72

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

where the second relation is obvious.
To demonstrate how the translation acts on a state, let us calculate,
r̂e(−ı/~)a·p̂ |ri = e(−ı/~)a·p̂ (r̂ + a)|ri = (r + a)e(−ı/~)a·p̂ |ri .

(2.169)

Hence,
Utr (a)|ri = e(−ı/~)a·p̂ |ri = |r + ai .

(2.170)

Therefore, if a particle is in an eigenstate |ri of the position operator (i.e. located
exactly at the position r), then after Utr (a) acts on it, the particle is at the position
r+a: The translation operator Utr (a) hence moves particles and fields by the distance
a.
Finally, we want to describe, how the translation operator acts on an arbitrary
state |ψi represented in position-space, remembering that the position-space wavefunction is obtained via ψ(r) ≡ hr|ψi, as already mentioned in Sec. 2.3.7. We get,
†
ψ 0 (r) ≡ Ttr ψ(r) ≡ hr|Utr (a)|ψi = hUtr
(a)r|ψi = hr − a|ψi = ψ(r − a) .

(2.171)

This relation is easier to remember as ψ 0 (r + a) = ψ(r), which can be read as: The
value of the new wavefunction at the new point equals the value of the old wavefunction
at the old point.
Example 14 (Translation of spatial wavefunctions): Here is an example
showing that these two descriptions (2.170) and (2.171) are equivalent. The
state |xi corresponds to the wavefunction ψ(r) = δ 3 (r − x), while the state
Utr (a)|xi = |x + ai corresponds to the wavefunction ψ 0 (r) = δ 3 (r − (x + a)).
These indeed satisfy ψ 0 (r) = ψ(r − a).

Rotation operator

In this section we look for the unitary transformation corresponding to the rotation
operator [612],
Trt r ≡ eα~ × r .

Urt

Urt (~

about the same axis α
~ = λ1 êα + λ2 êα , such that
Urt (λ1 êα )Urt (λ2 êα ) = Urt (λ1 êα + λ2 êα ) .

The solution of the last differential equation (2.180) is, with λ2 êα = α

(2.182)

The explicit form of L follows from its action on a state |ψi projected into position

Galilei and Lorentz boosts

The Galilei transform (or Galilei boost) is defined by,
Tv r = r + vt

and

Tv p = p + mv .

(2.187)

Holds Tv1 Tv2 = Tv1 +v2 . We derive the expression for the operator of this transformation from its actions on the position and momentum states. For the position we
have with (2.166),
UG (v)|ri ∝ e(−ı/~)p̂·vt |ri = |r + vti .

(2.194)

for any vectors a and b, and with that, using the Baker-Haussdorff formula (3.105),
we verify,

UG (v1 )UG (v2 ) = e(−ı/~)(v1 +v2 )·G−[v1 ·G,v2 ·G]/2~ = UG (v1 + v2 ) .

(2.195)

Obviously, for very high velocities, the Galilei-boost should be replaced by the
Lorentz transform (or Lorentz boost) [322]. Here, we only note, that the additivity
of velocities expressed by equation (2.194) does not hold for non-collinear relativistic
velocities 15 .
14 We need to keep in mind that, following Glauber’s rule, eÂ eB̂ = eÂ+B̂+[Â,B̂]/2 with Â ≡ v · p̂t
and B̂ ≡ v · r̂m. However, the commutator [v · p̂t, v · r̂m] = −ı~mtv2 is independent of p̂ and r̂,
such that it only contributes an unimportant phase.

Gauge transformations

We learn in electrodynamics 16 , that the motion of a particle carrying the charge q
and interacting with an electrical potential Φ(r, t) and a magnetic vector potential
A(r, t) is governed by the electric and the magnetic field,
~ t) = −∇Φ − ∂t A
E(r,

and

~ t) = ∇ × A .
B(r,

(2.196)

Also, we know that the fields are invariant under the substitution,
Φ → Φ0 ≡ Φ − ∂t χ

and

A → A0 ≡ A + ∇χ ,

(2.197)

where χ(r, t) is a scalar field called gauge field.
In quantum mechanics the gauge transformation defined by,
Ucl (χ) = e−ıqχ(r,t)/~

(2.198)

obviously must keep the Schrödinger equation invariant. Transforming operators and

CHAPTER 2. FOUNDATIONS AND MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

2.5.4

Noether’s theorem and conservation laws

The fundamental laws of physics are often expressed as symmetries. The knowledge
of symmetries allows the characterization of a system and its behavior without the
need to know its details. We can often deduce the differential equation of motion
from the symmetries. The fundamental symmetries define the fundamental laws of
physics. Following Noether’s theorem each symmetry corresponds to a conserved
quantity, that is, a quantities that remains invariant for all time. The invariance of a
system under symmetry transformation represents a conservation law. For example,
the homogeneity of space corresponds to the conservation of linear momentum.
In quantum mechanics, a symmetry transformation is defined by,
|ψi −→ U |ψi

and

Q̂ −→ U Q̂U † .

(2.205)

Therefore, to find a conservation law, i.e., an invariable observable (also called constant of motion), we must verify that the observable and the transformed wavefunctions simultaneously satisfy the same fundamental equations (that is, Schrödinger’s
or Heisenberg’s equation) as the original observable and wavefunctions. For example,
if the wavefunction |ψi satisfies the Schrödinger equation, the wave function U |ψi
must do this too,
!

ĤU |ψi = ı~

dU
d
dU
d
U |ψi = ı~
|ψi + ı~U |ψi = ı~
|ψi + U Ĥ|ψi .
dt
dt
dt
dt

(2.206)

Consequently, we obtain the relation,
[Ĥ, U ] = ı~U̇ .

(2.207)

As shown in (2.160) and (2.161), an operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian
does not explicitly depend on time, that is, it is conserved.
2.5.4.1

Temporal homogeneity

Temporal homogeneity means invariance under translation in time by a fixed time
interval τ , that is, under the unitary temporal transformation,
U (τ ) ≡ |ψ(τ )ihψ(0)| = e(ı/~)Êτ .

(2.208)

d (ı/~)Êτ
Since dt
e
= 0, this means [e(ı/~)Êτ , Ĥ] = 0, which implies conservation of
energy [Ê, Ĥ] = 0. This will be verified in the Exc. 2.5.5.3.

Example 15 (Homogeneity of time): We imagine the following mental experiment or Gedankenexperiment: We consider two attractive bodies that move
away from each other until they reach the perihelia. At this point, before the
bodies reapproach, we change the laws, for example, by modifying the force of
attraction. As a consequence, when the bodies arrive at the initial point, the
total energy is non-zero. Therefore, the conservation of energy indicates that
the laws are invariant.

2.5. SYMMETRIES IN QUANTUM MECHANICS
2.5.4.2

77

Temporal isotropy

The fundamental laws of classical physics and quantum mechanics are all symmetrical
under time reversal. That is, they are remain invariant when we change the arrow of
time, t → −t.
2.5.4.3

Spatial homogeneity

Spatial homogeneity means invariance under spatial translation, that is, under the
unitary translational transformation,
Z
Utr (a) ≡ |r + aihr|d3 r = e(−ı/~)p̂·a .
(2.209)
This is equivalent to momentum conservation [p̂, Ĥ] = 0

18

.

Example 16 (Homogeneity of space): Ehrenfest’s theorem says [p̂, H] =
−ı~ ∂H
. Therefore, the commutator is not zero when there is a potential, Ĥ =
∂ p̂
p̂2 /2m + V (r̂). This is obvious, because the potential introduces an energy
inhomogeneity to a particle interacting with the potential. However, this does
not mean that the space itself is inhomogeneous, because in order to verify the
translational invariance of space, we must displace the entire system, that is, the
particle together with the potential. For example, if the potential is generated
by another particle we must consider the Hamiltonian Ĥ = p̂21 /2m1 + p̂22 /2m2 +
V (r̂1 − r̂2 ).

2.5.4.4

Spatial isotropy

Spatial isotropy means invariance under rotation, that is, under rotational unitary
transformation,
Urt (φ) ≡ e(−ı/~)L̂φ .
(2.210)
This is equivalent to the conservation of angular momentum [L̂, Ĥ] = 0.
2.5.4.5

Parity conservation

Besides continuous symmetry transformations there exist discrete transformations.
Discrete symmetries are important in elementary particle physics. The parity conservation means invariance to spatial reflection: r → −r. A parity transformation is
18 Imagine that the forces attracting two bodies to each other are not equal: Contrary to Newton’s
third law, body A attracts body B, more than the body B attracts the body A. In that case after a
while the two bodies have different momenta. With the unitary transformation Utr (a) = e−ıp̂·a/~ '
1 − ıp · a/~ + ... we have,

Utr H|ψi = Utr Eψ |ψi = Eψ U |ψi = H|ψ(r + a)i =? = H|ψ(ri .
Since, [H, p̂] = 0, Heisenberg’s equation yields,

r = 0,
P̂ |ψ(r)i ≡ |ψ(−r)i .
(2.211)
with
P̂ 2 = P̂ .

(2.212)

We talk about even parity when P̂ |ψ(r)i = |ψ(r)i and odd parity when P̂ |ψ(r)i =
−|ψ(r)i. See Exc. 2.5.5.4.
2.5.4.6

Invariance to the velocity of the inertial system

The Galilei boost asks for Galilei invariance regarding the transformation,
ZZ
UG (v) ≡
|r + vt, p + mvihr, p|d3 rd3 p ,

(2.213)

that is, the independence of the inertial system on its velocity v.
2.5.4.7

Charge conservation

Let us consider again the gauge transform (2.197). We know that the Lagrangian
density in free space is given in terms of the potentials by,
L(xµ ) =
=

µν

~2
Fµν − Aµ j µ = ε20 E~2 − 2µ1 0 B

ε0

2 [∇Φ + ∂t A] − 2µ0 [∇ × A] − Φρ

− Aµ j µ

(2.214)

+A·j ,

and the action is simply the fourth-dimensional integral,
Z
S = L(xµ )dV dt .

(2.215)

From the Lagrangian formulation, Maxwell’s equations can be derived by requiring
the action to be minimal, δS = 0, which yields the Euler-Lagrange equations. As
the field equations do not change under gauge transformation, this implies that the
action is also unchanged.
To find the relation with charge conservation, we simply have to compare the
actions in different gauges. First, we express the Lagrangian transformed into the old
gauge,
L0 (xµ ) =

ε0
2 {∇[Φ

− ∂t χ ] + ∂t [A + ∇χ ]}2 −

− [Φ − ∂t χ]ρ + [A + ∇χ] · j

1
2µ0 {∇

0

× [A + ∇χ ]}2

(2.216)

= L + (∂t χ)ρ + ∇χ · j .

With this result, we can calculate the difference between the actions under gauge
transformation and recall, that they can not be different:
Z
Z
!
0
0 = S − S = [(∂t χ)ρ + ∇χ · j]dV dt = − χ[∂t ρ + ∇ · j]dV dt ,
(2.217)

2.6. FURTHER READING

79

using partial integration 19 and choosing volumes so large, that every charge is inside.
This is the continuity equation derived from the gauge invariance of the action. The
calculation really is nothing more than an application of Noether’s theorem from
which we could have derived directly the continuity equation, ∂µ j µ = 0.
In summary, the conservation of charge means invariance with respect to gauge
transformations,
Ucl (χ) ≡ e−ıqχ(r,t)/~ ,
(2.218)
where χ is the gauge field. We note that q and χ are conjugated observables. Therefore, if [χ, Ĥ] = 0, then the charge q is a conserved quantity.
Transformations can be combined. For example, we believe that nowadays all laws
are invariant with respect to CPT transformation, that is, a combination of charge
conjugation, parity inversion, and θ-transform.

Linear motion / Separable

In this chapter we will analyze the translational and vibrational motion of a quantum
particle. We will give special consideration to the rectangular potential and the
harmonic oscillator.

In one dimension the Hamiltonian of a free particle is,
Ĥ = −

~2 d2

2m dx2

(3.1)

Therefore, the general solution of the Schrödinger stationary equation,

Note that the eıkx functions are not quadratically integrable, since −∞ |eıkx |2 dx =

−∞
practice, we need to consider wave packets or specify a finite volume for the particle.
Note also that the spectrum of eigenvalues is continuous. Do the Exc. 3.1.3.1.

3.1.1

Quadratic integrability

To allow for an interpretation as probability density we need to ask for quadratic
integrability,
Z
|ψ|2 d3 r = 1 .
(3.4)

This means that the wavefunction can not be infinite inside a finite volume. But it
can be infinite within an infinitely small volume. Also, since the Schrödinger equation
contains the second derivative by position, the wavefunction must be continuous and
have a continuous derivative.

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS

Separation of dimensions

Frequently, a 3D potential can be written in the way,
V (x, y, z) = Vx (x) + Vy (y) + Vz (z) .

(3.5)

This is the case, for example, for a rectangular well with Vx (x) = Vy (y) = Vz (z) =
V0 /3 inside the well and V (x, y, z) = 0 outside. It also holds for a harmonic potential,

m 2 2
V (r) =
ωx x + ωy2 y 2 + ωz2 z 2 .
(3.6)
2
In these cases, the following ansatz for the wavefunction is generally useful,

(3.7)

Rectangular potentials

The continuity equation (2.16) teaches us that the probability flux of a moving particle
cannot make abrupt changes. That is, even if the particle encounters an obstacle
represented by a smooth or abrupt variation of the potential depth, the wavefunction
and its derivative must remain continuous, unless the potential step is infinitely high.

3.2.1

Let us now place the particle into a rectangular potential well, such that the Hamiltonian is,

Example 17 (Localization energy ): There is a minimal energy E1 = 2mL

which is called zero point energy or localization energy. This energy can be
understood as a consequence of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. We can make
the following gross estimation of the zero point energy. Obviously, the particle
is localized with an uncertainty lower than ∆x < L. Hence, ∆p > ~/∆x > ~/L.

The fact that the numerical value is different from the value calculated by the

Multidimensional box potential

In a multidimensional well there can be degeneracy if the well exhibits symmetries. In
the case of a 2D quadratic well Lx = Ly , the eigenenergies are doubly degenerate, since
Enx ,ny = Eny ,nx . In the case of a 3D cubic well Lx = Ly = Lz , the eigenenergies
are 6-fold degenerate, because Enx ,ny ,nz = Eny ,nz ,nx = Enz ,nx ,ny = Enz ,ny ,nx =
Eny ,nx ,nz = Enx ,nz ,ny . The states and energies of the 2D well are calculated in

where ka = ~1 2m(E − Va ). If E > Va , the wave is propagating. ka is the Broglie
wavevector of the wave. If E < Va , the wave is evanescent. That is, the wave decays
within a distance κa = −ika .
If the particle is confined, that is, if E < V (x → ±∞), the possible energy levels
are quantized and the spectrum is discrete.
For every transition between two sections a = 1 and a = 2 we require the boundary
conditions,
ψ1 (x) = ψ2 (x)

ψ10 (x) = ψ20 (x) .

Together with the normalization, 1 = −∞ |ψ| dx, these conditions are sufficient to
determine the wavefunction unambiguously.

Consider a particle with energy E and a potential well of finite depth such that
V (x) = V0 < 0 for −L/2 > x > L/2 and V (x) = 0 otherwise, as illustrated in

(3.23)

Therefore, this particle propagates towards +∞. On the contrary, the particle Be−ıkx
propagates towards −∞. Thus, the two solutions (3.13) of the Schrödinger equation
(3.12) correspond to propagating particle waves. From here on we will use the letter
A (B) to denote the amplitudes of waves propagating in direction ∞ (−∞).
In locations where the potential changes abruptly, the particle can be partially
reflected.

The matrix S describes the causality of scattering process more adequately: The

by the barrier and a wave A1 being transmitted by the barrier. The amplitude B1 in
region (1) results from the superposition of a wave A1 being reflected by the barrier
and a wave B2 being transmitted by the barrier. Therefore, the matrix S is more
appropriate for the description of the quantum reflection, as we will discuss in the
next section. However, it has the disadvantage that it can not be concatenated in the
same way as the T matrices.
Unlike the T matrix the S matrix is unitary, since

Quantum reflection at a potential step

The quantum reflection is a non-classical property of the motion of a particle. An
example is the reflection of a quantum particle by an attractive potential. To study
this effect, we consider a plane wave eık1 x propagating in region (1) (E1 > V1 ) encountering a potential step up or down at position x = 0 leading to another region
(2). Using the S matrix formalism introduced in the previous section,

We use B2 = 0, since no wave comes from the side of region (2), and A1 = 1,
because it simplifies the formulas and does not affect the generality of the results.
The interesting results are:
 Even when E2 < V2p
, the particle enters the classically prohibited region: ψ2 (x) ∝
e−κ2 x with κ2 = ~1 2m(V2 − E2 ), i.e. the transmission is non-zero, |A2 | > 0.

 Even with E2 > V2 , the particle has a probability of being reflected at the step,
|B1 | > 0.

a model describing the collision between attracting or repelling particles via a partial

Tunneling and quantum reflection at a potential well

Particles thrown with a kinetic energy E against potential barriers can cross them
even if V0 > E or be reflected even when V0 < E, as illustrated in Fig. 3.5(a). This
can be verified by considering a particle propagating from x = −∞ towards x = +∞
through a potential well located at x ∈ [0, a]. We determine the concatenation T =
T2→3 T1→2 . Then we find the S matrix that corresponds to the T matrix and solve the
problem in the same way as in the previous section. For example, we can calculate
the transmission and reflection probabilities. The formula is derived in Exc. 3.3.7.3,

The delta-potential

In quantum mechanics the δ-potential can be used to simulate situations, where a
particle is free to move in two regions of space with a barrier in between. For example,
an electron can move almost freely in a conducting material, but when two conducting
surfaces are put close together, the interface between them acts as a barrier for the
electron that can be approximated by a δ-potential. The δ-potential is a limiting
case of the finite potential well when we decrease its width while maintained the
product of its width and its depth constant. Here, for simplicity, we only consider a
one-dimensional potential well, but the analysis can be expanded to more dimensions.
The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the wavefunction ψ(x) of a particle
in one dimension is,

the blue solid curve corresponds to a deep barrier β = 10.
The potential is called a δ-potential well if α is negative and a δ-potential barrier if
α is positive.
The potential splits the space in two parts (x < 0 and x > 0). In each of these
parts the potential energy is zero, and the Schrödinger equation reduces to,
d2 ψ
2mE
=− 2 ψ .
dx2
~

(3.43)

This is a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, whose solutions are
linear combinations
of eıkx and e−ıkx , where the wavenumber k is related to the
√
2mE
energy by k = ~ . In general, due to the presence of the δ-potential in the origin,
the coefficients of the solution need not be the same in both half-spaces:
(
ψ1 (x) = A1 e−ıkx + B1 eıkx for x < 0
ψ(x) =
,
(3.44)
ψ2 (x) = A2 e−ıkx + B2 eıkx for x > 0
where, in the case of positive energies (real k), eikx represents a wave traveling to
the right, and e−ıkx one traveling to the left. One obtains a relation between the
coefficients by imposing that the wavefunction be continuous at the origin,
ψ(0) = ψ1 (0) = ψ2 (0) = A1 + B1 = A2 + B2 .

(3.45)

A second relation can be found by studying the derivative of the wavefunction.
Normally, we could also impose differentiability at the origin, but this is not possible

3.3.6.1

Bound states

The graph of the bound state wavefunction solution to the δ-function potential is
continuous everywhere, but its derivative is not defined at x = 0.
In any one-dimensional attractiveppotential there will be a bound state. To find
its energy, note that for E < 0, k = i 2m|E|/~ = iκ is imaginary and the wavefunctions which were oscillating for positive energies in the calculation above, are now
exponentially increasing or decreasing functions of x (see above). Requiring that the
wave functions do not diverge at infinity eliminates half of the terms: A1 = B2 = 0.
The wavefunction is then,

Scattering

For positive energies, the particle is free to move in either half-space: x < 0 or x > 0,
but it may be scattered at the delta function potential. The quantum case can be
studied in the following situation: a particle incident on the barrier from the left
side (B1 ). It may be reflected (A1 ) or transmitted (B2 ). To find the amplitudes for
reflection and transmission for incidence from the left, we put in the above equations
B1 = 1 (incoming particle), A1 = r (reflection), A2 = 0 (no incoming particle from
the right), and B2 = t (transmission), and solve for r and t even though we do not
have any equations in t. The result is,

for the particle to be reflected. This does not depend on the sign of λ, that is, a
barrier has the same probability of reflecting the particle as a well. This is a significant
difference from classical mechanics, where the reflection probability would be 1 for
the barrier (the particle simply bounces back), and 0 for the well (the particle passes
through the well undisturbed). The probability for transmission is,

An application example regards the interfaces between two conducting materials.
In the bulk of the materials, the motion of the electrons is quasi-free and can be
described by the kinetic term in the above Hamiltonian with an effective mass m.
Often, the surfaces of such materials are covered with oxide layers or are not ideal
for other reasons. This thin, non-conducting layer may then be modeled by a local
δ-function potential. Electrons may then tunnel from one material to the other giving
rise to a current.

Example 19 (Double delta potential ): The δ-function model is actually a
one-dimensional version of the hydrogen atom. The model becomes particularly
useful when applied to the hydrogen molecule ion, as shown in the following.
The double-well δ-function models a diatomic hydrogen molecule by the corresponding Schrödinger equation:

where 0 < R < ∞ is the ’internuclear’ distance with δ-function (negative) peaks
located at x = ±R/2 (shown in brown in the diagram). Keeping in mind the
relationship of this model with its three-dimensional molecular counterpart, we
use atomic units and set ~ = m = 1. Here 0 < λ < 1 is a formally adjustable
parameter. From the single well case, we can infer the ’ansatz’ for the solution
to be:
R
R
ψ(x) = Ae−d|x+ 2 | + Be−d|x− 2 | .
Matching of the wavefunction at the δ-function peaks yields the determinant:

Thus, d is found to be governed by the pseudo-quadratic equation:
n

d± (λ) = 12 q(λ + 1) ± 12 q 2 (1 + λ)2 − 4λq 2 [1 − e−2d± (λ)R ]
,
which has two solutions d = d± . For the case of equal charges (symmetric
homonuclear case), λ = 1 and the pseudo-quadratic reduces to:
d± = q[1 ± e−d± R ] .
The ’+’ case corresponds to a wave function symmetric about the midpoint
(shown in red in the diagram) where A = B and is called gerade. Correspondingly, the ’-’ case is the wavefunction that is anti-symmetric about the

3.3. POTENTIAL BARRIER

95

midpoint where A = −B is called ungerade (shown in green in the diagram).
They represent an approximation of the two lowest discrete energy states of the
three-dimensional H+
2 and are useful in its analysis. Analytical solutions for the
energy eigenvalues for the case of symmetric charges are given by:
d± = q + W (±qRe−qR )/R ,
where W is the standard Lambert function. Note that the lowest energy corresponds to the symmetric solution d+ . In the case of unequal charges, and for
that matter the three-dimensional molecular problem, the solutions are given
by a generalization of the Lambert function (see section on generalization of
Lambert function and references herein).
One of the most interesting cases is when qR ≤ 1, which results in d− = 0.
Thus, one has a non-trivial bound state solution with E = 0. For these specific
parameters, there are many interesting properties that occur, one of which is
the unusual effect that the transmission coefficient is unity at zero energy.

Numerical approaches for arbitrary potentials

In practice, many potentials are not box-shaped or harmonic, which renders an analytic treatment difficult or impossible. To some extend approximation methods can
be used, as discussed in Sec. 6.5, but many problems can only be solved numerically.

3.4. NUMERICAL APPROACHES FOR ARBITRARY POTENTIALS

97

In Sec. 3.4.1 we will first show at the example of arbitrary one-dimensional potentials,
how the Schrödinger equation can be solved numerically and how this allows one to
determine the eigenenergies of bound states. In Sec. 3.4.2 we will introduce the very
efficient Fourier grid method for calculating bound state energies and wavefunctions.

3.4.1

Calculation of free and bound states wavefunctions

Numerical routines or packages are available for solving ordinary differential equations
(ODE). Generally it is advantageous to convert the one-dimensional second-order
Schrödinger equation into two first-order differential equations via,
ϕ0 (x) =

2m
[E − V (x)]ψ(x)
~2

and

ψ 0 (x) = ϕ(x) .

(3.56)

For free states, E > V (x), we just solve equation (3.56) specifying the kinetic
energy of the particle. The magenta curve in Fig 3.10(a) is an example of a collisional
wavefunction in a Morse-type interatomic potential.
For bound states, we must additional satisfy the eigenvalue problem, since only
specific discrete eigenenergies E are permitted. A possible procedure consists in
guessing an eigenvalue E, calculating the associated wavefunction ψ(x) using an ODE
solver, check whether it diverges for x → ±∞, and vary E until ψ(x) no longer
diverges. Then we repeat the procedure for are bound state energies, until we got
them all. The red curve in Fig 3.10(a) shows the wavefunction of a vibrational state
in a Morse-type potential obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation and adjusting
the energy until the function stops diverging in the classically forbidden range. In this
example the iteration process was stopped when the wavefunction diverged at around
R ≈ 19aB . In Exc. 3.4.3.1 we will practice this technique at the example of Hermite’s
differential equation, and in Exc. 3.4.3.2 we will study the case of a potential whose
depth linearly increases with the distance from origin.

3.4.2

The Fourier grid method for bound states

The objective of the Fourier grid method is to analytically solve the 1D Schrödinger
equation with an arbitrary potential V (r) on a grid of 2N + 1 equally spaced spatial
points ri , where i = 0, ±1, ..., ±N . That is, we assume the potential V (ri ) to be given
at these points. Skaling by the spatial coordinate r by r/L = x/2π, we get for the
dimensionless coordinate x the Schrödinger equation,

with the grid given by,

(3.58)

The main difficulty for numerically solving such eigenvalue equations is obviously
the derivative. Numerical differentiation schemes can be cast into the following general
form [425],

that is, they can be expressed as a multiplication of the discretized wavefunction
represented as a vector f (xj ) and a matrix Dij . These schemes are usually based on
interpolation polynomials and are the more accurate, the higher the order of these
polynomials is chosen to be.
Instead of using interpolation polynomials, one may now consider over-all approximation of a function f (x) by a Fourier series of N -th order, i.e. to assume,
f (x) =

molecule or in a crystalline lattice, of particles trapped in applied electric or magnetic
fields, or light in an electromagnetic mode. Most periodic movements are approximately harmonic for small amplitude vibrations and can be treated in a way that we
will detail now.

~ω − 2 ,

E
− 12 |ψi ≡ n|ψi =⇒ |ψi = |ni .
(3.72)
â† â|ψi = ~ω

Now, we show that the states â|ψi are eigenstates of the operator defined as n̂ ≡ â† â,
since,
â† ââ|ψi = (ââ† − [â, â† ])â|ψi = (ââ† â − â)|ψi = â(â† â − 1)|ψi = (n − 1)â|ψi
=⇒ â|ψi ∝ |n − 1i ≡ C|n − 1i

=⇒ n = hn|â† â|ni = C 2 hn − 1|n − 1i
√
=⇒ C = n .

(3.73)

We note that the quantum number of the new |n − 1i is decreased by 1. Similarly,
we show for the state â† |ψi,
â† ââ† |ψi = â† ([â, â† ] + â† â)|ψi = â† (1 + â† â)|ψi = (n + 1)â† |ψi
=⇒ â† |ψi ∝ |n + 1i ≡ C|N + 1i

=⇒ n + 1 = hn|â† â + [â, â† ]|ni = C 2 hn + 1|n + 1i
√
=⇒ C = n + 1 .

(3.74)

Therefore, this new state is also an eigenvector |n + 1i, with a quantum number
increased by one unit. â† and â are creation and annihilation operators of an energy
packet,

â† |ni = n + 1|n + 1i

Properties of the harmonic oscillator

We note that there are regions where ψ(x̃) 6= 0 even though V (x) > E. This effect is
purely quantum. Classically, we can not find a particle in regions where its energy is
below the potential.
We also note that for high quantum numbers, n → ∞, we expect to recover the
classical predictions, i.e.,

there were a box into which we add, one after the other, particles with the energy ~ω
until we have accumulated n portions of energy. These particles are called phonons
in the case of vibrations of massive particles, and photons in the case of a radiation
field.
The fact that the energy distribution is the same as the one proposed by Planck
for the black-body radiation suggests the use of the harmonic oscillator to describe
the second quantization.

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS

If the oscillator is initially in an eigenstate, |ψ(0)i = |ki, we obtain,
|ψ(t)i = e−ıωt(k+1/2) |ki

hψ(t)|Â|ψ(t)i = hk|Â|ki ,

and

(3.100)

that is, the state remains stationary. Motion needs non-diagonal elements of Â.
Another observation is that the populations do not change, even in the case of an
initial superposition, since,
Pk (t) = |hk|ψ(t)i|2 = |e−iωt(k+1/2) ck |2 = |ck |2 .

(3.101)

We conclude that
 movement of an observable Â is possible, but only due to variations of the phase
factors;
 to carry out transitions between the vibrational states is necessary to perturb
the oscillator, e.g. by applying fields of electromagnetic radiation.

specific examples. If the studied observable is the Hamiltonian and the initial

That is, the particle can only oscillate, if there are populations in consecutive

is always ω, independent of the energy of the particle. We will study this
in Excs. 3.5.6.3, leaving the discussion of the temporal evolution of perturbed
oscillators to later sections.

we can separate the spatial directions and obtain a one-dimensional equation for each
coordinate, such that the coordinates can be considered separately. Each function
ψk (xk ) is of the form (3.91) and the energies are,

Consider a HO of

(n + 1/2)~ω.

c. Given that the normalized state vector |ψ(0)i is defined to less than an overall

Superposition states of a harmonic oscillator

As any other quantum system, a harmonic oscillator does not need to be in a particular vibrational eigenstate. In fact, it is much more common to encounter them
in superpositions of many states. In a system in thermal equilibrium, the energetic
distribution of occupied states reflects the temperature of the system.

108

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS

3.6.1

Coherent states

The most common superposition for a harmonic oscillation is a Poissonian probability
distribution of occupied vibrational (Fock) states. This state, called coherent or
Glauber state, has particular features that we will discuss in the following sections.
3.6.1.1

Glauber’s formula

A useful formula that we will use later is the Glauber formula (or Baker-Hausdorff
formula),
eÂ eB̂ = eÂ+B̂+[Â,B̂]/2 ,

(3.105)

which holds for [Â, [Â, B̂]] = [B̂, [Â, B̂]] = 0, i.e. when Â and B̂ commute with their
commutator.
Example 22 (The Baker-Hausdorff formula): In order to prove the BakerHausdorff formula, we consider the operator,
Ĝ(τ ) ≡ eτ (Â+B̂) e−τ B̂ e−τ Â .
The derivative is,
Ĝ0 (τ ) = (Â + B̂)eτ (Â+B̂) e−τ B̂ e−τ Â − eτ (Â+B̂) B̂e−τ B̂ e−τ Â − eτ (Â+B̂) e−τ B̂ Âe−τ Â

[−τ B̂, [−τ B̂, Â]] + .. e−τ B̂ e−τ Â ,
= eτ (Â+B̂) Â − Â + [−τ B̂, Â] + 2!
using the formula (2.164). If now [Â, [Â, B̂]] = 0 = [B̂, [Â, B̂]], then,
Ĝ0 (τ ) = eτ (Â+B̂) τ [B̂, Â]e−τ B̂ e−τ Â = −τ [Â, B̂]eτ (Â+B̂) e−τ B̂ e−τ Â = −τ [Â, B̂]Ĝ(τ ) .
The solution of this differential euation is,
Ĝ(τ ) ≡ e−(τ

2

/2)[Â,B̂]

Ĝ(0) .

With Ĝ(0) = 1 we obtain at the point τ = 1,
eÂ+B̂ e−B̂ e−Â = e−(1/2)[Â,B̂] .

3.6.1.2

Displacement operator

We now consider the so-called displacement operator 3 ,
D̂(α) ≡ eαâ

†

−α∗ â

,

(3.106)

and try to discovers its features.
3 The operator acts on the phase space spanned by the operators â and â† , that is, x̂ ∝ Re â and
p̂ ∝ Im â.

3.6. SUPERPOSITION STATES OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

The state |αi is called coherent state or Glauber state 4 . We note that, in spite of
its appearance, the equation (3.112) is not an eigenvalue equation, since â is not
observable.
Using the formula (2.164), we verify immediately,
D̂† (α)âD̂(α) = â + α

,

D̂† (α)â† D̂(α) = â† + α∗ .

(3.113)

using the notation â† ||αi = α||αi.

states in the phase space spanned by α = Re α+ıIm α = |α|eıφ . The uncertainty of Glauber
states ∆x and ∆p is represented by a finite distribution of the amplitude α in the phase space.

Furthermore, the product of two displacement operators is, apart from a phase factor,
another displacement operator satisfying,

(3.114)

as will be verified in Exc. 3.6.6.1. When acting on an eigenket, the phase factor

Uncertainty in Glauber states

Consider a HO prepared in a state |αi. The eigenvalues of the observables x̂ ≡

And finally, we find the Heisenberg relation,

(3.118)

3.6. SUPERPOSITION STATES OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

111

Comparing with the uncertainty relation (3.82) derived for Fock states, we conclude that the uncertainty is always smallest for Glauber states. In this sense, the
Glauber states are the ones which are closest to classical states characterized by the
absence of uncertainty.
3.6.1.4

Orthogonality of Glauber states

Glauber are not orthogonal, since,
2

|hα|βi|2 = e−|α−β| .

(3.119)

We leave the demonstration for Exc. 3.6.6.2, but we note here already that for |α −
β|  0 the states are approximately orthogonal. The reason for this is, that the
respective population distributions through the Fock states, |hn|αi|2 and |hn|βi|2 , do
not overlap and hence do not interfere. The state |αi + | − αi is sometimes called
Schrödinger cat state. In Exc. 3.6.6.4 we will show why such states are very difficult
to detect.

3.6.2

Kicking a harmonic oscillator

Let us now study the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator subject to a kick. By kicking
we understand a translation in momentum space defined by the Galilei boost operator
(2.189),
UG (k) ≡ eık·r̂ ,
(3.120)
where p = ~k is the gain in momentum due to the kick. A common situation where
such a kick occurs is the photonic recoil that an atom receives upon absorption of a
photon. Using the relationship (2.164) derived in Exc. 2.5.5.1 it is easy to verify the
following expressions of the left-hand panel,

V (r̂ + b)

2

(3.121)
The rule imply [eık·r̂ , p̂] 6= 0 6= [eık·r̂ , Ĥ]. That is, we describe the kick by simply
adding the corresponding momentum ~k to the system and adjusting the kinetic
energy accordingly. Of course the assumption of an infinitely fast transition is an idealization and the ultimate reason for the non-conservation of momentum and energy
by the system. In real situations, such as in the case of photonic recoil, the dynamics
should be described by a collision process which conserves momentum and energy.
The right-hand panel of Eq. (3.121) summarizes rules for calculating with the
spatial displacement operator introduced in Sec. 2.5.1,
Utr (b) ≡ e−ıb·p̂/~ .

By analogy we find [e−ıb·p̂/~ , r̂] 6= 0 6= [e−ıb·p̂/~ , Ĥ].

3.6.2.1

Transitions between vibrational states via momentum kick

Let us now restrict to one dimension and study, how the transformation operators
UG = eıkx̂ and Utr = e−ıbp̂/~ couple the vibrational states of a harmonic oscillator.
With the formalism developed in the last sections and with the abbreviation,
√
α ≡ ıkaho / 2 ,

we find,

(3.124)

which is nothing else than the displacement operator (3.109) generating coherent
states, |αi = D(α)|0i. That is, the momentum kick attempts to put the oscillator
into a coherent state with the mean occupation number n = |α|2 = 21 k 2 a2ho . Note
that the same effect is obtained setting,

(3.131)

Formula (3.131) tell us that the probability for a transition between vibrational
states depends on the parameter kaho , which we will discuss in the next section.
For small kaho it gets increasingly more difficult for the system to leave the original
vibrational state |ni and to form a coherent state. After a momentum kick, the
population is coherently distributed over several vibrational states in a way to fulfill
momentum and energy conservation. Let us consider, for simplicity, an initial state
|0i. If the kick is weak or the trap strong (i.e. if |α| < 1), the atom will stay in |0i with
a high probability amplitude and go to |1i only with a small probability amplitude.
We will derive in Exc. 3.6.6.5 the general expression for the transition matrix element

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS
Lamb-Dicke regime

We already introduced |α| as the amplitude of the coherent vibrational state created
by kicking a harmonic oscillator. Defined as,
r
~
1
√
with
aho ≡
.
(3.134)
η ≡ |α| = 2 kaho
mωho
the so-called Lamb-Dicke parameter measures the degree of confinement of a particle in
a harmonic trap with respect to the momentum shift. We say that we are in the LambDicke regime, when the particle is localized to a volume smaller than wavelength,
2πx0  λ, corresponding to the momentum kick.

Figure 3.15: Illustration of the Lamb-Dicke parameter.

We can also rewrite the Lamb-Dicke parameter in terms of the trap’s secular
frequency, ωho , and the recoil-shift,
η=

r

ωrec
ωho

with

ωrec ≡

~k 2
,
2m

(3.135)

where we understand the recoil-energy ~ωrec as the kinetic energy gained through
the recoil acceleration. In this form the Lamb-Dicke parameter tells us that, in the
Lamb-Dicke regime, the energy of the momentum kick is not sufficient to efficiently
excite vibrational states,
(2n + 1)~2 k/m  ωho .
(3.136)
That is, cold particles in low vibrational states n can not accommodate the recoil
shift within the vibrational spectrum of the trap. Consequently, the recoil cannot be
transferred to the particle itself, but must be absorbed by the entire trap. This is the
case of the strong binding regime in ion traps, which is analogous to the Mößbauer
effect discussed in Sec. 19.3.3.
Finally, the Lamb-Dicke parameter can be rewritten in terms of the inverse Doppler
modulation index,
η=

kvmax
2ωho

with

m 2
v
= ~ωho .
2 max

(3.137)

Accelerated by the momentum kick, the atom will execute harmonic oscillations with
frequency ωho and with the maximum velocity-excursions vmax . Hence, any quantity
depending on the atomic velocity, e.g. the Doppler-shift, will be modulated. We will
discuss this in Sec. 19.3.3, as well.

3.6. SUPERPOSITION STATES OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
Example 23 (Absorption of recoil by a molecular dimer ): To be able to
discuss the validity of energy and momentum conservation in a kicked system, let
us consider a molecule made of two atoms with masses m1 and m2 . Then we kick
atom 1 via the momentum shift operator eikx̂1 (e.g. during a photon absorption
process with the associated recoil) and analyze the motional dynamics of the
whole system. (We restrict ourselves to one dimension.)
The first step is to write down the Hamiltonian,

We find that,

This means that the kick operator simultaneously acts on both: the center-ofmass receives a recoil accelerating it by an amount pcm = ~k, and the vibrational
relative motion receives a kick of an amount prl = ~km2 /M following the dynamics described in Sec. 3.6.2.
Obviously, the total system conserves momentum, which is imparted to the

115

3.6.3

Shaking a harmonic oscillator

As we mentioned below the formulae (3.121), the transformation in momentum space
is not a realistic concept for a kick. In practice, a kick will always be the results of
a collision, which is understood here as a scattering of a free (massive or massless)
particle at our harmonically trapped particle. And the scattering process will take a

e−(ı/~)Ĥt = e−ıωho t(n̂+1/2)−(ıΩt/2)(âe +â e

(3.140)
To simplify the propagator, we first have a closer look at the terms âeıωho t and

certain amount of time,

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS
Displaced harmonic oscillator

To begin with, we will derive the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator suddenly exposed
to a homogeneous constant force F (t) = mg Θ[0,∞] (t). It is easy to see, that the
above perturbed Hamiltonian can be cast into the form,


Ĥ(t) = −

where the last constant term plays no role in the dynamics. Knowing the eigenvalues
and -states of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, the obvious solution of the perturbed
eigenvalue problem is,
Ĥ|ψn(1) i = En(1) |ψn(1) i

(3.150)

with En(1) = En −

and hx|ψn(1) i = ψn(1) (x) = ψn (x −

Using the properties (2.166) and (2.168) we may write,

†

and using the representation (3.80) of the momentum operator by the field operators
and introducing the abbreviation β ≡ ω2 ag √2 we can rewrite,
ho ho

hx −

†

= e−β(â−â ) hx|ni .

(3.152)

Note, that the transition from (3.148) to (3.150) can also be obtained by a redefinition
of the field operators according to,
b̂ ≡ â −

mga√
ho
~ωho 2

,

(3.153)

since,
Ĥ = ~ωho (â† â + 12 ) −

mg 2
2

(3.154)

and â − â† = b̂ − b̂† .
The temporal evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
Since the jump is finite, the solution must be well behaved at time t = 0,
hx|ψn(1) (t)i = hx|e−(ı/~)Ĥt |ψn(1) (0)i

†

To simplify the first three exponential functions, we use the relationships (3.144) and
(3.141) 6 ,

3.6.4.2

where

p̄(t) ≡ −m ωgho sin ωho t .

(3.161)

Discussion of the kick dynamics

For the acceleration of the harmonic oscillator to resemble a ’kick’, the time during
which the perturbation is active must be much smaller than a trap oscillation period,
ωho ∆t  1. In this case, we may expand the oscillatory motion (3.159) and (3.161),
x̄ =

g
2
ωho

and

p̄ = −mg∆t ≡ −~k ,

(3.162)

which is consistent with the initial request (3.147). It is also clear that, for a given
force mg, the maximum momentum that can be transmitted is limited, ~k < mg/ωho .
As long as the kick-approximation ωho ∆t  1 holds, we may simply describe the
dynamics during the application of the force, via a time-dependent kick operator,
eık(t)x̂ = D(α(t)) ,

(3.163)

120

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS

where the acquired momentum increases linearly with time according to k(t) =
k max(min(t,∆t),0)
. I.e. the populations of the vibrational states evolve like (3.127)
∆t
into a coherent state with increasing amplitude |α(t)|2 . At the end of the kick, on
−1
a much slower time-scale ωho
, the wavefunctions will start to oscillate all in phase,
according to (3.159).
The time-dependence of the states |α(t)i, as shown in Exc. 3.6.6.7 is given by 7 ,

(3.165)

hα(t)|p̂|α(t)i = mωho hα(0)|x̂|α(0)i sin ωho t + hα(0)|p̂|α(0)i cos ωho t
We note, that the position and momentum wavefunctions hx|ni and hp|ni of the
excited vibrational states are complicated Hermite polynomials, but we don’t have
to write them down explicitly to get to the last result. We will derive some further
properties in 3.6.6.8.

|ψ(t)i = n e−ıωho (n̂+1/2)t an |ni.
Various quantities now are interesting to plot as a function of time. Firstly, we

The temporal evolution of the forced harmonic oscillator defined by (3.168) can
be numerically propagated. In cases where the force varies in time, the propagation
can be done iteratively by subdividing time in intervals tk − tk−1 for k ∈ N sufficiently
small that the force can be considered constant within them,
|ψ(tk )i = e−(ı/~)Ĥ(tk −tk−1 ) |ψ(tk−1 )i .
The results of such a simulation are illustrated in Fig. 3.18.

Quantization of the electromagnetic field

The quantization of light (also called second quantization) triggered by Max Planck’s
treatments of black-body radiation in 1905 resolved the problem of the ultraviolet
divergence and explained the photoelectric effect. Twenty years later the quantization of the atom by Niels Bohr (also called first quantization) explained the internal
structure of the atom.
The operator for the electric field of a laser mode is given by,
p

Ê = ıE1 [âeık·r−ıωt − â† e−ık·r+ıωt ] ,

(3.176)

where E1 = ~ω/2ε0 V is the electric field generated by a single photon in the mode
volume V . Exc. 3.6.6.9 asks to calculate the eigenvalues hÊi and ∆Ê.
It is sometimes convenient to represent the light field by its quadratures. With the
definition â ≡ x̂1 + ıx̂2 , where x̂1,2 are non-commuting observables ([x̂1 , x̂2 ] = ı/2),

3.6. SUPERPOSITION STATES OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

we can write the field as,
Ê = −2E1 [x̂1 sin(k · r − ωt) + x̂2 cos(k · r − ωt)] .

3.7. (QUASI-)PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

3.7

125

(Quasi-)probability distribution functions

As we have seen in the last sections, quantum observables are intrinsically affected by
quantum noise, which leads to a spreading of their representation in phase space. For
the case of Glauber states of a harmonic oscillator we illustrated in Fig. 3.13 the uncertainty of conjugate variables by circles around their expectation values whose areas
are determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. These circles represent phase
space probability distribution functions. These are distribution functions measuring
the probability to encounter the observables at specific points in phase space.
States other than Glauber states are possible, for instance Fock or cat states. Some
of these states may exhibit quantum correlations, which we would like to identify in
probability distributions. Quantum correlation in systems with small Hilbert spaces,
such as the two-level atom, are conveniently represented by a density operator or
by the Bloch vector introduced in Eq. (2.48). Large or infinite Hilbert spaces require
different approaches. We have seen in Sec. 3.6.1 how to expand the state of a harmonic
oscillator on a Fock state basis. On the other hand, we have seen that Glauber states
are more ’natural’ states for a harmonic oscillator, so that we would like to visualize
expansions of arbitrary states into a coherent state basis.
The following sections are devoted to introducing various such distribution functions [555] and to calculating them for a selection of particular states, such as the Fock
and the Glauber state, the thermal state, and the Schrödinger cat state. We will restrict the discussion to pure states, postponing a discussion of the representation of
statistical mixtures to Sec. 15.2, where we will also extend the discussion to quantum
correlations in light fields resulting from a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction of an
atom with a light mode.

3.7.1

The density operator

We define the density operator for a pure state as,
ρ̂ ≡ |ψihψ| .

(3.179)

A detailed discussion of the density operator for non pure states, that is, statistical
mixtures will be given in Sec. 14.1. The definition (3.179) is independent from a
chosen basis, but a proper representation can be found by simply expanding the state
|ψi on a proper basis.

3.7.2

The Wigner function

The Wigner function represents something like the spectrum of two-dimensional
phase-space correlation function. For a pure state and a one-dimensional system
it is defined by,
Z
1 ∞
hψ|x + yihx − y|ψie2ıpy/~ dy .

For a harmonic oscillator, the Wigner function can be embedded into a formalism
that will be detailed in the following sections.

3.7.3

P , Q, and Wigner functions for the harmonic oscillator

The most common distribution function in a coherent state basis are the so-called P function (or Glauber-Sudarshan representation), the Q-function (or Husimi representation), and the (already introduced) Wigner function. Defining the two-dimensional
complex inverse Fourier transform by,
Z

(3.181)

with
d2 λ = dRe λ dIm λ = drλ dpλ ,
these three coherent distribution functions are expressed by inverse Fourier transforms
of the following characteristic functions 8 ,

the distribution functions χN,S,A are related to each other. Using the Baker-Hausdorff
formula (3.105) we derive in Exc. 3.7.5.1 the so-called disentangling theorem [233],

Z
(3.185)
ρ̂ = P (α)|αihα|d2 α ,
and Q(α) is the expectation value of the density operator (3.179):

(3.186)

The various states that a light field can adopt can now be expressed either by
photon number distribution in a Fock state basis, or by two-dimensional weighting
functions P, Q, W in a coherent state basis. Here, are some examples for these representations.

We know from microscopic systems, for instance a two-level atom, that they can
live in superposition states |1i + |2i. In contrast, the Schrödinger cat states discussed
above occur in continuous Schrödinger fields involving many particles. Macroscopic
quantum interferences (i.e. interferences that are detectable with macroscopic apparatuses, for example in heterodyne schemes) are named fuzzy Schrödinger cats, if the
interfering states are conspicuously separated in phase space.
At this point, we have to emphasize the fundamental difference between Schrödinger
cats and superpositions of modes,
|ψi =
ρ̂ =

|αi + |βi

=
6 |αi|βi

|αihα| + |βihβ| + |αihβ| + |βihα| =
6 |αβihαβ|

.

(3.202)

3.7. (QUASI-)PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

131

Schrödinger cats exhibit interferences in phase space, whereas for mode superpositions, interferences only appear when a parameter is varied (e.g., the length of an
interferometer arm).
Schrödinger cat states are very sensitive to dissipation and easily converted into
statistical mixtures. For example, |αi ± | − αi contains only odd (even) photon numbers in the distribution function Pn . After some time ∼ τcav /N , the distribution is
converted into a Poisson distribution. The higher the particle number N , the faster
the decoherence will be. Consequently, truely macroscopic cat states have never been
observed.

This state can be expanded into Glauber states |αi by following procedure. For large

P|ni (α) = δ (1) (|α| −

CHAPTER 3. LINEAR MOTION / SEPARABLE POTENTIALS

Squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator
The squeezing operator

Let us consider a Hamiltonian of the following form,
Ĥsqz = ~ωâ† â + 2ı ~ξâ†2 + 2ı ~ξ ∗ â2 .

(3.211)

leading to the equation of motion,
â˙ = −ıωâ + 2gâ† .

(3.212)

The non-linear, i.e. quadratic, appearance of the field operators suggests that the
interaction should include correlation pair production, as is the case for parametric
processes or four-wave mixing. We will see later that cavities are good for producing
squeezing. However, the unused ports of a cavity let vacuum fluctuations come in,
which partially overrule squeezing.
For now, we study, in analogy with the displacement operator (3.106), the propagator e−ıĤsqz t/~ , i.e the operator given by,
Ŝ(ξ) ≡ eξâ

†2

/2−ξ ∗ â2 /2

,

(3.213)

which we will call the squeezing operator because, applied to the vacuum state, |ξi =
S(ξ)|0i, this operator will compress the uncertainty of one quadrature component, as
we will see shortly.
In analogy with the calculation (3.107), using the commutation rules, it is possible
to verify the unitarity of this operator [390] (see Exc. 3.8.4.1). In particular, using
∗
the relationship (2.164) and the abbreviation Â ≡ 2ξ â†2 − ξ2 â2 , we can show [600]
(see Exc. 3.8.4.2),

(3.215)

The formulas (3.215) describe a Bogolubov transform, as they can be cast into the
form,
b̂ ≡ uâ + vâ†

,

b̂† ≡ u∗ â† + v ∗ â ,

(3.216)

for complex numbers u and v. By postulating the same commutation relation for new
operators, [b̂, b̂† ] = 1, we immediately get the condition,
|u|2 − |v|2 = 1 .

(3.217)

3.8. SQUEEZED STATES OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

135

Comparing with the hyperbolic identity cosh2 r − sinh2 r = 1, we can parametrize the
constants as,
u = cosh r
and
v = eıϕ sinh r .
(3.218)
This is interpreted as a linear simplectic transformation in phase space between
pairs of annihilation and creation operators satisfying the same commutation relation [â, â† ] = 1.
3.8.1.1

Relation between squeezing and displacement operator

The squeezing operator does not commute with the displacement operator. However,
from (3.215) we an derive the following simple relation,
Ŝ(ξ)D̂(α) 6= D̂(α)Ŝ(ξ) = Ŝ(ξ)D̂(α cosh r + α∗ eıθ sin r) .

(3.219)

Solve the Exc. 3.8.4.3.
Squeezed coherent states are generated by coherent displacement of a squeezed
vacuum,
|α, ξi = Ŝ(ξ)|0, ξi = D̂(α)Ŝ(ξ)|0i .
(3.220)
On the other hand, from (3.219),
D̂(α)Ŝ(ξ)|0i = Ŝ(ξ)D̂(α cosh r + α∗ eıϕ sinh r)|0i

(3.221)

= Ŝ(ξ)|α cosh r + α∗ eıϕ sinh ri .
3.8.1.2

Squeezing of the uncertainty relation

The real and imaginary parts of the transformed operators, defined by b̂ = x̂b + ıŷb ,
are Hermitian and satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (2.87),
[x̂b , ŷb ] =

(3.222)

However, let us take a look at the uncertainties separately. They relate to the
Glauber mode via,
x̂b = 21 (b̂ + b̂† ) = 21 (â cosh r + â† eıϕ sinh r) + 21 (â† cosh r + âe−ıϕ sinh r)

For the squeezed vacuum state the photon number distribution displays odd-evenoscillations. This can be explained by the mathematical form of the squeezing operator, that resembles the operator for two-photon generation and annihilation processes.
Photons in a squeezed vacuum state are more likely to appear in pairs.

Rotations / Central potentials
Rotations are, on the same rights as translations, symmetry operations in space. They
are of fundamental importance for the discussion of composite particles, such as atoms
because they help us to formulate appropriate boundary conditions facilitating the
solution of the three-dimensional Schrödinger equation.

4.1

Particle in a central potential

Many potentials do not have Cartesian symmetry, but fortunately, many problems
have some kind of symmetry, cylindrical, spherical or periodic. Those with cylindrical
or spherical symmetry can be solved by separating the curvilinear coordinates, as we
will show in the following. Particularly important are spherical potentials caused by
central forces, for example, the Coulomb force between the proton and the electron
in the hydrogen atom.

4.1.1

Transformation to relative coordinates

The hydrogen atom represents a two-body problem. We consider the two masses m1,2
of a proton and an electron separated by a distance r and interacting through a
potential V (r). The Hamiltonian is
Ĥ =

where r1,2 are the positions of the proton and the electron. With the ansatz Ξ(t, r1 , r2 ) =
Ξ(r1 , r2 )e−ıEtot t/~ , the time-dependent Schrödinger equation

The equation (4.7) is three-dimensional because Ψ(r) is a scalar field and the momentum operator in Cartesian coordinates is given by,
∇2r =

(4.8)

However, in some situations, the symmetry of the system allows to reduce dimensionality similarly to the cases of the box potential and the three-dimensional harmonic
oscillator. Let us now discuss the cases of cylindrical and spherical symmetry.
Electrons in magnetic fields are subject to the Lorentz force, which keeps them in
a rotating motion. We can rewrite the momentum operator in cylindrical coordinates,
x = ρ cos ϕ

Example 26 (Rigid rotor in cylindrical coordinates): To give an example,
we disregard the potential, V (ρ) = 0, and we consider for the particle an orbit
with constant radius, ρ = const such that R0 (ρ) = 0. In this case, we only need
to treat the orbital motion described by the right part of Eq. (4.14). For the
solution of this equation, ξ(ϕ) = Aeımϕ ϕ , to be well-defined, we need ξ(ϕ) =
ξ(ϕ + 2π). This implies,

It is easy to show that wavefunctions with different values ml are orthogonal.
Note: 1. The state mϕ = 0 has zero energy; that is, it has no zero-point energy.
2. The particle is delocalized within a ring of radius r: ∆lz ∆ sin ϕ ≥ ~2 |hcos ϕi|.

Quantum treatment of hydrogen

According to Rutherford’s and Bohr’s planetary atomic model we may imagine an
atom as a very heavy nucleus having a positive electric charge surrounded by a very

4.2. QUANTUM TREATMENT OF HYDROGEN

147

light negatively charged charge electronic cloud. Since the nucleus is very small compared to the electronic cloud, we treat it as an entity with mass M and charge Ze,
where Z is the number of protons and corresponds to the order of the element in the
periodic system.
The canonical procedure for calculating all properties of an atom is to establish
its Hamiltonian, that is, to determine the kinetic energies of all components and all
interaction energies between them, and to solve the Schrödinger equation. For each
component we write the kinetic energy,
Tncl =

P2
2M

and

Tele =

(4.37)

Here, (R, P) are the nuclear coordinates and (ri , pi ) those of the electrons. The energies that corresponds to the interactions, that is, Coulombian attraction or repulsion,
between the components of the atom are,

(4.38)

There are also interactions due to the spin of the particles, which we will deal with
later.
Obviously, the solution to this many-body problem is very complicated. For this
reason, we will in this chapter, based on the Schrödinger equation, calculate the
complete spectrum of the simplest possible atom, hydrogen. This atom consists of a
proton and an electron, only.

Figure 4.3: The hydrogen model applies to other atoms having a single valence electron
occupying a sufficiently large space, that it sees the nucleus together with rest of the electrons
shielding the nucleus as a single positive charge.

4.2.1

Bohr’s model

Let us now turn our attention to the radial part of the Schrödinger equation describing
a particle in a radial potential. We expect that the quantum solutions for the hydrogen
atom are similar to the predictions of Bohr’s model. Following this model, the orbit
is stable when the attraction force is equal to the centrifugal force. But in addition,
Bohr postulated, that only certain energies are allowed. For the hydrogen atom he
found,

With this equation he was able to explain the spectral observations. Electrons can
only jump from one level to another, while emitting or absorbing a photon. The series

In order to facilitate comparison with Bohr’s classical model, let us express the energy

To ensure that for large radii, r → ∞, the solution is finite, we need an asymptotic
behavior like un` (r̃ → ∞) = e−r̃/n . To ensure that for small radii, r → 0, the
solution is finite, we need un` (r̃ → 0) = r̃`+1 . We derive the asymptotic solutions in
Exc. 4.2.3.1. The resulting differential equation only has solutions for an integer and
positive main quantum number n and when ` = 0, 1, .., n − 1. That is, in the relation
E = E1 /n2 the parameter n is integer and positive, such that energy levels remain
degenerate in ` and m. This means that Bohr’s postulate of discrete (i.e. quantized)
energy levels is valid (uff!)
Substituting the ansatz,
un` (r̃) = Dn` r̃`+1 e−r̃/n L(r̃) ,

(4.43)

The virial theorem

Originally derived for classical mechanics, the virial theorem also holds for quantum
mechanics, as shown for the first time by Fock. We evaluate the commutator between

152

CHAPTER 4. ROTATIONS / CENTRAL POTENTIALS

the Hamiltonian
Ĥ = p̂2 /2m + V (r̂) ,

(4.54)

and the product of the position operator r̂ with the momentum operator p̂ = −ı~∇
of the particle:

p̂2
+ ı~r̂ · ∇V ,

(4.55)

using the theorems of Ehrenfest. Therefore, we find for the operator Q̂ = r̂ · p̂ the
commutator,
ı
[Ĥ, Q̂] = 2Ekin − r̂ · ∇V .
(4.56)
~
The left side of this equation is precisely −dQ̂/dt, following the Heisenberg equation
of motion. The eigenvalue hdQ̂/dti of the temporal derivative vanishes in steady state,
therefore we obtain the virial theorem,
2hEkin i = hr̂ · ∇V i .

(4.57)

for a central potential V (r) ∝ rs we obtain,

Figure 4.7: Illustration of angular momentum in quantum mechanics.

4.3.1.1

Constants of motion

The preceding chapter dealt with the resolution of the radial and angular equations
for the case of a radial potential. The radial equation allowed to calculate the eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian Ĥ,
Ĥ|ψi = En` |ψi .
(4.59)

We also found the common eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of operators l̂2 and ˆlz
[see Eqs. (4.20) and (4.24)]. We now use the notation |`, mi ≡ Y`m (θ, φ) for the
eigenfunctions,
l̂2 |`, mi = ~2 `(` + 1)|`, mi

and

ˆlz |`, mi = ~m|`, mi .

(4.60)

With this we have,

and

[Ĥ, l̂2 ]|ψi = Ĥ~2 `(` + 1)|ψi − l̂2 E|ψi = 0
[Ĥ, ˆlz ]|ψi = Ĥ~m|ψi − ˆlz E|ψi = 0 .

(4.61)

Therefore, the operators l̂2 and ˆlz are constants of motion,
[Ĥ, ˆlz ] = 0 = [Ĥ, l̂2 ] .

(4.62)

Exc. 4.3.4.3 asks to show explicitly, at the example of an isotropic three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, that l̂2 and ˆlz are constants of motion.

4.3. ANGULAR MOMENTUM

4.3.2

SU(2) algebra of angular momentum and spin

So far, we have solved the angular eigenvalue equation in the spatial representation
for an orbital angular momentum, l̂ = r̂×p̂. But it is not clear, whether every angular
momentum has this representation, which is derived from classical notions. In fact,
we will see that the electron has an intrinsic spin with no orbiting charges. What we
must show now is that for any spin ĵ satisfying
ĵ × ĵ = ı~ĵ ,

(4.63)

or [ĵm , ĵn ] = ı~kmn jk using the Levi-Civita symbol, we obtain a consistent algebra.
Since ĵ2 and ĵz commute (we show this from Eq. (4.63) in Exc. 4.3.4.4), they have
common eigenfunctions |j, mi. We can write the eigenvalues as,
ĵ2 |j, mi = ~2 j(j + 1)|j, mi

and

ĵz |j, mi = ~m|j, mi ,

(4.64)

where, for now, we only know that m is real and j ≥ 0. But since hj, m|ĵ2 |j, mi ≥
hj, m|ĵz2 |j, mi, it is clear that j(j + 1) ≥ m2 .
4.3.2.1

Creation and annihilation operator

Now we introduce the rising operator ĵ+ and the lowering operador ĵ− via
ĵ± ≡ ĵx ± ıĵy

such that

†
ĵ− = ĵ+
.

(4.65)

ĵ∓ ĵ± = ĵ2 − ĵz2 ∓ ~ĵz .

(4.66)

It is easy to check the following relationships
[ĵz , ĵ± ] = ±~ĵ±

and

[ĵ2 , ĵ± ] = 0

and

With this we find

and

ĵz ĵ± |j, mi = ([ĵz , ĵ± ] + ĵ± jz )|j, mi = ~(m ± 1)ĵ± |j, mi
2

2

(4.67)

2

ĵ j± |j, mi = ĵ± ĵ |j, mi = ~ j(j + 1)ĵ± |j, mi .

That is, ĵ± |j, mi is a eigenstate of ĵ2 and ĵz with the eigenvalues j and m ± 1,
respectively, if j± |j, mi =
6 0. Hence,
ĵ+ |j, mi ∝ |j, m + 1i .

(4.68)

In order not to violate the condition m2 ≤ j(j + 1), we need to fix ĵ± |j, ±ji = 0.
Therefore, for a specified j, the m can have only one of the 2j + 1 possible values
m = −j, −j + 1, .., j. Since 2j + 1 is an integer, j can only have values j = 0, 21 , 1, 32 , ...
Thus, the eigenvalue equation of the observables ĵ2 , ĵ is solved since we could have
chosen instead of ĵz any one of the components of ĵ, knowing that the others do not
commute with the chosen one.
All spin components ĵz and the scalar ĵ2 can only have discrete eigenvalues. The
smallest unit is ~/2. With the normalization hj, m|j 0 , m0 i = δj,j 0 δm,m0 we have,
hj, m|ĵ∓ ĵ± |j, mi = hj, m|(ĵ2 − ĵz2 ∓ ~ĵz )|j, mi = ~2 [j(j + 1) − m(m ± 1)] ,

In Exc. 4.3.4.5 we calculate the uncertainty of the angular momentum components, in
Exc. 4.3.4.6 we write the operator ĵx in a matrix form, and in Exc. 4.3.4.7 we calculate
projections of the spin of the electron in different directions of the quantization axis.

The electron spin

Every angular momentum l̂ generates a magnetic dipole moment µ

exert forces on dipole moments, F = −∇(~
µ` · B), which are detected by the SternGerlach experiment. This experiment reveals not only the quantization of angular
momentum, but also the presence of semi-integral values for the magnetic quantum
number.
In 1925 Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit proposed that the electron could have an intrinsic angular momentum with the quantum number s = 1/2. This angular momentum,
called spin, would not correspond to any orbiting mass or charge distribution within
the classical radius of the electron of the type l = r × p. The spin is a purely quantum phenomenon because it disappears when ~ → 0. It is believed nowadays that
the electron is actually point-like with no detectable deviation from Coulomb’s law at
any distance. The spin of the electron does not follow from the Schrödinger equation,
but can be included, ad hoc. On the other hand, it is interesting that it is a necessary
consequence of the stringent relativistic derivation of quantum mechanics by Paul
Dirac.
To characterize the spin, we can use the whole SU(2) formalism of the quantum
mechanics of angular momentum:
ŝ × ŝ = ı~ŝ ,

spin projection in z-direction:
Ŝz |+i = ~2 |+i

Coupling of angular momenta
Singlet and triplet states with two electrons

In this section we first consider the spin states of two electrons, which can be combined
into two groups with well-defined total spin. With this we can understand the energy

spectrum of helium, which is very much dominated by Pauli’s principle and quantum
statistics. The introduced concepts can be extended to atoms with many electrons.
Angular momentum is an important quantum number in the treatment of the
internal structure of atoms. The two electrons in the helium electronic shell each
contribute a spin of S = 12 , which couple to a total angular momentum. Let us
consider, for simplicity, two free electrons. The state of the two-particle system is
an element of the product space of the two Hilbert spaces in which the individual
electrons are described. We will now apply the formalism of Sec. 2.3.8 explicitly to a
pair of electrons. The states that the two electrons can occupy are:

Now, we look for the eigenvalues of the total angular momentum. The equation for
the eigenvalues of Sz ,
Ŝz |γk i = MS |γk i ,
(4.77)

4.4. COUPLING OF ANGULAR MOMENTA

159

is already diagonal in the introduced basis {γk } with the eigenvalues,
MS = ~, 0, 0, −~ .

(4.78)

For Ŝ2 the situation is more interesting: The states |γ1 i and |γ4 i are eigenstates of
S2 for the eigenvalue 2~2 , but the states |γ2 i and |γ3 i are not eigenstates. On the
other hand, we know that the linear combination of two eigenstates with the same
eigenvalue is also a eigenstate. Therefore, the states
|γa i =

√1 (|γ2 i
2

− |γ3 i)

and

|γs i =

√1 (|γ2 i
2

+ |γ3 i) ,

(4.79)

are still eigenstates of Ŝz , but they also are eigenstates of Ŝ2 , since we can easily
verify,
Ŝ2 |γs i = 2~2 |γs i
and
Ŝ2 |γa i = 0~2 |γa i ,
(4.80)

using the matrices (4.75). In summary, for the eigenvalue hŜ2 i = 2~2 there exist the
following three states:

|γ1 i Ms = 1 
triplet , S = 1
(4.81)
|γ4 i Ms = −1

|γs i Ms = 0

For hS2 i = 0 there is only one state:

|γa i Ms = 0

singlet , S = 0 .

(4.82)

By exchanging the two electrons, the vectors |γ1 i and |γ4 i retain their shape,
while the mixed vectors change their shape: γ2 ←→ γ3 . Under particle exchange |γa i
reverses its sign, that is, it is antisymmetric, while |γ1 i, |γ4 i and |γc i conserve their
signs, that is, they are symmetrical.
In summary, the triplet states have the quantum number of the total angular
momentum (with the expected value for Ŝ2 of ~2 S(S + 1) = 2~2 ), and they are
symmetrical about the exchange of particles. The singlet state has the quantum
number of the total angular momentum S = 0, and it is antisymmetric about the
exchange of particles.
A similar treatment can be done with bosons, as will be discussed in Sec. 10.1.

4.4.2

Coupling two spins

We now consider a perturbation of the system which, for some reason, only affects
the first spin. In the absence of the second atom we would have,

CHAPTER 4. ROTATIONS / CENTRAL POTENTIALS

In this case, the perturbation Hamiltonian does not commute with the total angular
momentum,
[Ŝ2 , Ĥ] 6= 0 .

(4.85)

Another type of perturbation affects both spin symmetrically (e.g., Dicke superradiance with two atoms in the same radiative mode or two counterpropagating modes
in a ring cavity). The interaction Hamiltonian is now the sum of the individual
perturbations,



(4.86)
Ĥ = Ĥ1 ⊗ I + I ⊗ Ĥ1 = 

This Hamiltonian commutes with the total angular momentum,
[Ŝ2 , Ĥ] = 0 .

(4.87)

S now is a good quantum number. Singlet states do not couple with triplets. This
is the idea behind Dicke’s superradiance. The absolute value of the total angular
momentum is conserved. The quantum number S is called Dicke cooperativity [175].
Example 29 (Two atoms interacting through their dipole moments): As
an example of a system exhibiting coupling of the type described in (4.86) we
consider two atoms j = 1, 2 interacting through their dipole moments. First,
without interaction the Hamiltonian will be,
Ĥ = ~ω0 Ŝz ,

(4.88)

with Ŝz given by (4.75).
Now, the atoms interact via their dipole moments with an electromagnetic field
assumed to be the same for both atoms,
Ĥint = −A(r1 ) · (êx σ̂ x ⊗ I + êy σ̂ y ⊗ I) − A(r2 ) · (êx I ⊗ σ̂ x + êy I ⊗ σ̂ y ) , (4.89)
with r1 ' r2 . By the rules (4.74) we find in matrix notation a Hamiltonian
equivalent to (4.86),

Note, that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, although it consists of sums of oper±
ators σ̂1,2

couplings generated by terms expressions like σ̂1+ σ̂2− .

That is, the Hamiltonian (4.88) does not mix antisymmetric singlet states and

4.4.3

Decoupled and coupled bases

Electrically charged orbiting particles produce a magnetic field. This field can influence the motion of other particles. In the same way, the spin of an electron can
influence its own orbital motion. That is, angular momenta can couple and interact in
a complicated way. Even to describe the behavior of an atom as simple as hydrogen in
an external field, we need to construct the eigenstates of the total angular momentum
resulting from a coupling of the electron’s intrinsic spin and its orbital motion.
On the other side, we have hitherto considered predominantly hydrogen and
hydrogen-like atoms, that is, atoms with a nucleus and a single (valence) electron.
But in fact atoms can have more than 100 electrons, which complicates the exact description. In atoms with many electrons, one of the most common coupling schemes
is when
P the angular momenta of all electrons couple toPa total angular momentum,
L̂ = k l̂k , which then couples to the total spin, Ŝ = k ŝk , to form the complete
total angular momentum, Ĵ = L̂ + Ŝ. We generally assign total momenta to capital
letters.
Adopting an unbiased notation we study some properties of the total angular
momentum, ĵ ≡ ĵ1 + ĵ2 . In Exc. 4.4.5.1 we find that the addition of angular momenta
produces a quantity which is also an angular momentum, but not the subtraction.
The angular momenta of two particles or two angular momenta of different origins
in a single particle represent independent degrees of freedom, [j1 , j2 ] = 0. Without

CHAPTER 4. ROTATIONS / CENTRAL POTENTIALS

interaction between angular momenta the Hilbert spaces are orthogonal:

0 H2

(4.93)

The eigenfunctions act on a space of dimension, dim H1 · dim H2 :
|j1 , mj1 ; j2 , mj2 i .

(4.94)

That is, there is a complete set of commuting operators {ĵ21 , ĵ1z , ĵ22 , ĵ2z }. Therefore,
we can specify quantum numbers j1 , j2 , mj1 , and mj2 simultaneously. On the other
hand, the group {ĵ21 , ĵ22 , ĵ2 , ĵz } also represents a complete set of commuting operators,
as shown in Exc. 4.4.5.2. It has the basis
|(j1 , j2 )j, mj i .

(4.95)

To describe the two angular momenta simultaneously we must opt between the
decoupled picture |j1 , mj1 ; j2 , mj1 i and the coupled picture |(j1 , j2 )j, mj i. For now,
the choice of the picture makes no difference, but we will see later that there may
be an energy associated with the coupling 3 . In this case, as we will show, that
the choice of the coupled base is more natural, because the energy commutes like
[Ĥ, ĵ2 ] = 0 = [Ĥ, ĵz ], but [Ĥ, ĵ21 ] 6= 0 6= [Ĥ, ĵ22 ].

Figure 4.8: Illustration of the coupling of two angular momenta.

4.4.3.1

Allowed values of total angular momentum

Since we do not specify an interaction energy between the spins or between spins and
external fields, all states are energetically degenerate. In the decoupled image the
degeneracy is easily calculated,
#=

mj1 =−j1

j2

1 = (2j1 + 1)(2j2 + 1) .

(4.96)

mj2 =−j2

Now we need to find the possible values of j and mj in the coupled picture. The
values of mj follow immediately from ĵ1 + ĵ2 = ĵ,
mj = mj1 + mj2 .

(4.97)

3 That is, the Hamiltonian of the system does not contain terms of type ĵ · ĵ , but may have
1
2
terms proportional to ĵ1 + ĵ2 .

4.4. COUPLING OF ANGULAR MOMENTA

163

With |mj1 | ≤ j1 and |mj2 | ≤ j2 the values of mj are limited to
|mj | ≤ j1 + j2 .

(4.98)

We often know the two angular momenta j1 and j2 and all their projections in the
decoupled base,
|mj1 | ≤ j1
and
|mj2 | ≤ j2 .
(4.99)
To find the quantum numbers in the coupled base, we arrange the states ordering
them by their total magnetic quantum number mj . We can, without loosing generality, concentrate on the situation j1 ≥ j2 . The following table reproduces the possible
combinations. The x-symbols represent Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:

the total degeneracy is,

2j + 1 = (2j1 + 1)(2j2 + 1) .

Example 30 (Spin states in the presence of L·S coupling ): As an example
we consider two electrons occupying the (5p)2 orbital. That is, both electrons
have si = 12 and `i = 1. As illustrated in Fig. 4.9, the coupling first gives
S = s1 + s2 = 0, 1 and L = `1 + `2 = 0, 1, 2. Then we determine the possible
values of the total angular momentum J = L + S = 0, 1, 2 depending on the
values of L and S.

4.4.4

Clebsch-Gordan coefficients

For now, we will only describe how to add two angular momenta, ĵ1 and ĵ2 . Since
they act on different degrees of freedom,

for arbitrary vectors α

where η are the eigenvalues of other observables commuting with ĵ1 and ĵ2 . These
eigenvectors give the values ~2 j1 (j1 + 1) and ~2 j2 (j2 + 1) for the observables ĵ21 and
ĵ22 , as well as ~m1 and ~m2 for the observables jz1 and jz2 . The number of states

momentum ĵ = ĵ1 + ĵ2 . Since
[ĵ, ĵ21 ] = 0 = [ĵ, ĵ22 ] ,

(4.103)

there exist common eigenstates |j1 , j2 , j, mi for the set of observables ĵ21 , ĵ22 , ĵ2 and

k sk ,
and P
separately the orbital angular momenta to a total orbital angular momentum,
L = k lk . These two total spins now couple to a total angular momentum, J = L+S.
When this LS-coupling happens, the following notation is used to characterize the
electronic states in atoms:

There is also the case that for each electron its spin couples to its own orbital angular

electrons, J =

c. A transition between a ground hyperfine state and an excited hyperfine state can
be described by a coupling of the total angular momentum F with the angular momentum of the photon κ forming the angular momentum of the excited state F 0 . To
see this, we now consider the levels F = 1 and F 0 = 2. Expand the coupled angular
momentum |(F, κ)F 0 , mF 0 i = |(1, 1)2, mF 0 i on a decoupled basis for every possible
value mF 0 . Use the table in Fig. 4.10 to determine the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
Note: The Clebsch-Gordans only compare the oscillator strengths of transitions between Zeeman sub-states of a given set (F, F 0 ). In order to compare the oscillator
strengths to other transitions (F, F 0 ) it is necessary to calculate 6j-coefficients.

Periodic systems
Many physical systems treat quantum particles in periodic potential. Examples are
electrons in crystals or cold atoms in optical lattices. The periodicity gives rise to a
wealth of new phenomena, such as Bragg scattering, the formation of energy bands,
Mott insulators, or Bloch oscillations. Various theoretical approaches have been developed leading to a deep understanding of the features of crystals, metals, and optical
lattices for atomic gases.
In the following sections we will mainly focus on the Bloch model, which is based
on introducing periodic boundary conditions to the Schrödinger equation. In the
Secs. 5.1 we will give a brief introduction into the Bloch model for electrons in solids,
where the periodicity is imposed by the crystalline structure of the material. We
will, however, no go into details leaving a comprehensive treatment to specialized
textbooks [20, 355]. In the Secs. 5.2 we will concentrate on optical lattices for atomic
gases formed by counterpropagating laser beams. The physical realization of these
lattices, which can be realized with nearly perfect periodicity, have permitted the
experimental observation of phenomena which had been elusive in solid state physics.

5.1

The Bloch model for electrons

The motion of an electron inside a crystal is ruled by a spatially periodic potential V (r)
originating from the positively charged crystal atoms and the mean field produced by
the quasi-free electrons,
V (r) = V (r + R) ,
(5.1)
where R is a vector connecting two arbitrarily chosen atoms of the lattice. With the
Hamiltonian
~2 2
Ĥ = −
∇ + V (r)
(5.2)
2m
we can write the Schrödinger equation,
[Ĥ + V (r)]ψ(r) = Eψ(r) .

(5.3)

Since V and ∇ are invariant under translations Utr (R)ψ(r) ≡ ψ(r + R) by a fixed
distance R, where the translation operator has been defined in Eq. (2.170), we have,
ĤUtr (R)ψ(r) = EUtr (R)ψ(r) .
171

(5.4)

172

CHAPTER 5. PERIODIC SYSTEMS

That is, for a non-degenerate eigenvalue 1 ,
ψ(r + R) = f (R)ψ(r) .

(5.5)

This relation holds for all vectors R of the lattice, such that,
f (R1 + R2 )ψ(r) = ψ(r + R1 + R2 ) = f (R1 )ψ(r + R2 ) = f (R1 )f (R2 )ψ(r) . (5.6)
The relationship f (R1 + R2 ) = f (R1 )f (R2 ) is satisfied by the ansatz f (R) ≡ eık·R ,
where k is an arbitrary vector of reciprocal space. We get the famous Bloch theorem,
ψk (r + R) = eık·R ψk (r) ,

(5.7)

which represents a necessary condition for any eigenfunction ψk of the Schrödinger
equation with periodic potential. Bloch’s theorem simply postulates that, apart from
a phase factor, the wavefunction has the same periodicity as the potential.
The Bloch function,
ψk (r) ≡ uk (r)eık·r

with

uk (r + R) = uk (r) ,

(5.8)

automatically satisfies Bloch’s theorem. That is, the wave function of the electron
ψ is a plane wave eık·r modulated by a function uk having the same periodicity as
the lattice [361]. Although the vector of the electronic wave is arbitrary, it is possible
(and useful) to restrict its value to the first Brillouin zone defined by k ∈ [−π/a, π/a],
where a is an elementary vector of the lattice. The reason is that we can reduce a
wavevector k in a wavefunction trespassing the first Brillouin zone by an appropriate
vector G of reciprocal lattice,
k0 = k + G ,
(5.9)
yielding,

0

ψk (r) = uk (r)eık·r = uk (r)e−ıG·r eık ·r .

(5.10)

We now define another function uk0 (r) ≡ uk (r)e−ıG·r , which also satisfies the requirement (5.8), knowing that G · R = n2π, we see,
uk0 (r + R) = uk (r + R)e−ıG·(r+R) = uk (r)e−ıG·r = uk0 (r) .
Hence,

5.1.1

0

ψk (r) = uk0 (r)eık ·r = ψk0 (r) .

(5.11)
(5.12)

Approximation for quasi-bound electrons

We now assume that the behavior of the electron near an atom is not influenced by
atoms farther apart,
X
ψk (r) =
ci (k)φ(r − Ri ) .
(5.13)
i∈lattice

That is, we neglect superposition states of the electron at various sites of the lattice.
The atom is subject to a potential Uat (r − Ri ) located near the atom at the position
1 This

also holds true for degenerate eigenvalues if we choose suitable basis of eigenvectors.

(5.14)

Even so, the function ψk (r) must satisfy Bloch’s theorem. This is the case when
ci (k) = eik·Ri and therefore,
ψk (r) =

eık·Ri φ(r − Ri ) .

Example 32 (Ansatz for a quasi-bound electron wavefunction): The

U (r) is the potential energy of the electron illustrated in Fig. 5.1 together with the

calculate,

The functions φ∗ (r − Rj ) and φ(r − Ri ) overlap only a little, even for adjacent atoms,
such that we can neglect the terms i 6= j on the left side. The sum then corresponds
to the number N of sites in the lattice. On the right side we can not neglect the
terms involving other sites, because even if the wavefunctions of adjacent sites overlap
little, the contribution of the potential difference |U (r) − Uat (r − Ri )| is much lower
for r = Ri than for r = Rj . On the other hand, as the wavefunctions φ(r − Ri )

The interpretation is as follows: The combination of the atoms in a lattice produces
an energy displacement α. In addition, it generates a spitting into a continuous band
of energies as a function of reduced wavevector k...

5.1.2

Approximation for quasi-free electrons

Here we assume an essentially homogeneous potential acting on the free electrons
and consider the impact of the periodic lattice as a small perturbation. The periodic
potential can be decomposed into a Fourier series by the vectors G of the reciprocal
lattice,

U (r) =

Consequently, we can make for Bloch functions (5.10) the following periodic ansatz,

CHAPTER 5. PERIODIC SYSTEMS

∗
Since the potential U (r) is real, U−G = UG
. Therefore, introducing the eigenenergies
E0 (k) of free electrons (5.24),

E(k) = E0 (k) ± |UG | .

(5.33)

Under the influence of the periodic perturbation potential we find at the surfaces of
a Brillouin zone an energy splitting developing a forbidden gap in the spectrum. We
can understand this observation as follows: In the crystal all electronic waves with
wavevectors ending on a surface of a Brillouin zone are reflected by Bragg reflection.
In the example of a one-dimensional lattice we understand that the superposition
of an incident wave (k = nπ/a) with the reflected one (k = −nπ/a) produces a
standing electronic probability density wave ρ being proportional to ρ1 ∝ cos2 nπ/a
or ρ2 ∝ sin2 nπ/a. The charge density ρ1 is maximal at the location of the atom
in this site, which corresponds to an increased interaction energy; the density ρ2 is
minimal at the location of the atom. This explains the splitting.
The Bloch model can explain many properties of metals, semiconductors and
insulators.

5.1.3

One-dimensional periodic potentials

In the following, we restrict ourselves to a one-dimensional potential, V (z) = V (z +a),
acting on (the center-of-mass of) atoms. How such potentials can be realized in
practice will be shown in Sec. 5.2. For now, we just assume that we can write the
potential as,
V (z) = −2V0 cos2 Kz .

The requirement that ψ(z) satisfies the Schrödinger equation is equivalent to the
condition that c satisfies an eigenvalue equation. Let U be the matrix of the eigenvectors of Ĥ and Ê the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues: Ĥ = U −1 ÊU gives ÊU c = εU c,

Bloch oscillations

A Bloch oscillation is a phenomenon in solid state physics. It is the oscillation of a
particle (e.g., an electron) confined to a periodic potential (e.g. a crystal), when a constant force (e.g., generated by a continuous electric field) acts on it. This phenomenon
is very difficult to observe in solid crystals because, due to electron scattering by defects of the lattice [143, 482], the coherent evolution is limited to a small fraction
of the Brillouin zone. However, Bloch oscillations were observed in semiconducting
superlattices, in ultrathin Josephson junctions, and with cold atoms in optical lattices

Optical lattices

Periodic potentials for quantum particles can be realized artificially. A prominent
example are optical lattices formed by the interference patterns of intersecting laser
beams. Tuned sufficiently far away from atomic resonances the periodically structured
light field exerts optical forces on the atoms which can be derived from potentials
being proportional to the local light intensity. As these forces are relatively weak,
the kinetic energy of the atoms must be very low (typically µK) to allow for their
impact to be relevant. In many cases, the depth of the optical lattice only allows for a
small number of localized quantum states, so that the quantum nature of the atomic
motion becomes highly relevant. Famous examples are the Bloch oscillations and the
Mott insulating states.
We are not yet prepared to understand, how these potential arise from the lightatom interaction, as this topic will only be treated in the Secs. 19.2 and in Chp. 22.6.1.
However, this is not necessary to understand many of the features of the atomic
dynamics in optical lattices. We will thus simply impose a known periodic potential
to a cold atomic cloud and study its energetic band structure and the atomic motion.
Various three-dimensional crystalline geometries have been realized and studied
[332, 261, 70]. In the following, we will mainly focus on one-dimensional lattices,
leaving a discussion of phenomena specific to three-dimensional lattices to future
sections.

CHAPTER 5. PERIODIC SYSTEMS

Atoms in 1D optical lattices

As already pointed out, a periodic optical potential can be generated by two counterpropagating plane wave laser beams, e±ıkl z , with wavevectors kl and −kl and tuned
to the red side of an atomic transition. In this situation the atoms are attracted to
the maxima of the light intensity, the antinodes,
V (z) =

Applying the procedure unfolded in Sec. 5.1.3 to the optical lattice, we expand the
motional atomic wavefunction into plane (Bloch) waves,

where |cn (t)|2 are the population of momentum states separated by 2kl in momentum

any value of q, yielding the dispersion relation already exhibited in Fig. 5.3.

Bloch oscillations of atoms in 1D optical lattices

Neutral atoms in a vertical optical lattice are accelerated by gravity, and this accelerated motion leads to Bloch oscillations [143, 482]. To treat this case, we could simply
replace the electric force −eE~ in the expression (5.52) by the gravitational force mg
and obtain the result,
mgλl
ωblo =

(5.61)

with the wavelength λl = 2a of the counterpropagating lasers generating the standing
wave.
For didactic reasons, however, let us formulate the problem in the language introduced in the previous section extending the Hamiltonian by the gravitational potential 3 ,

The center-of-the mass momentum of the atomic matter wave is,
X

(5.66)

The Bloch oscillations can be understood in various pictures. The first one, illustrated in 5.4(a), is based on Bragg reflection: A resting atom has infinite de Broglie
wavelength. Being constantly accelerated by gravity, the matter wave reduces its de
Broglie wavelength from ∞ to a value, where it becomes commensurate with the periodicity of the standing light wave potential. At this moment Bragg scattering comes
into play, reflecting the atomic motion back into upward direction, and the process
starts over again. The atoms evolve like jumping on a trampoline with a frequency
given by νblo .
To understand the second picture, we need to address a question we have left aside
so far, as this requires a notion of optical forces. It is the question in which way the
3 For Bose-Einstein condensates, the procedure should be generalized taking into account the
energy of the mean field.

182

CHAPTER 5. PERIODIC SYSTEMS

matter wave interacts with the standing light wave. For the present discussion, it is
sufficient to know that the atom must have an internal transition capable of scattering
photons from the light beams. As any absorption and emission process transfers a
recoil momentum of ~kl to the atom, we can understand the Bragg scattering process
as a so-called Raman scattering process: a photon of the laser beam generating the
optical lattice coming from the left is absorbed and re-emitted to the left. This is best
illustrated in the momentum domain sketched in Fig. 5.4(b). This Raman scattering
transfers twice the photonic recoil to the atom. The requirement for commensurability
of the Broglie wavelength and wavelength of the standing light wave is equivalent to
saying that the matter wave momentum is equal to the recoil of a single photon. In
other words, the matter wave always Bragg-reflected at the edge of a Brillouin zone.
Finally, in the Bloch state picture, the dispersion relation of a free particle is
distorted due to the periodicity of the potential generated by the standing light wave
such as to open a forbidden band. As a consequence, instead of being accelerated
without limits, the atom enters the second Brillouin zone, which is to say that it is
reflected to the other side of the first Brillouin zone.

Figure 5.4: Illustration of Bloch oscillations (a) in real space, (b) in momentum space, and
(c) in the moving frame. You may also run a movie of Bloch oscillations clicking on (watch
movie)!

The additional term, which contains the frequency of the Bloch oscillation νblo ,
increases linearly over time. As time goes by, a resonance is crossed when t = −nτblo ,
and the crossing is periodically repeated at every n = −1, −2, 0, ... Tracing the
matter wave evolution in the laboratory system, we see that whenever the resonance
is crossed, the momentum undergoes a change of sign corresponding to a reflection
of its motion. We expand the population of the momentum states into plane (Bloch)
waves with |cn (t)|2 .
Of course there are some conditions that need to be met to observe Bloch oscillations. The transfer of momentum is efficient only in the rapid adiabatic passage
(ARP) regime characterized by the conditions 2(νblo /ωrec )  (W0 /4ωrec )2  16.
The first condition requires that the force that drives the atoms to perform the Bloch
oscillations must be weak enough to avoid transitions between Bloch bands, which
guarantees the adiabaticity of the process. The other condition requires that the

The Kronig-Penney model

The Kronig-Penney model describes the band structure of a lattice. Let us assume a
periodic potential of rectangular wells with valleys of widths a and peaks of widths b,
V (x) = U0 θmod(x,a+b)∈[a,a+b] .

(5.67)

Inserting into the Schrödinger equation the plane wave ansatz ψ = AeıKx + Be−ıKx
for the wavefunction in the valley, 0 < x < a, and ψ = CeQx + De−Qx in the
peak, −b < x < 0, we obtain ε = ~2 K 2 /2m and U0 − ε = ~2 Q2 /2m. Choosing the
constants A, B, C, D such that ψ and ψ̇ are continuous in x = 0, a, we derive, using
the periodicity of the Bloch wave ψ(a < x < a + b) = ψ(−b < x < 0)eik(a+b) ,

Approximation methods
Virtually every problem going beyond the potential well, the harmonic oscillator, or
the hydrogen atom without spin and external fields is impossible to solve analytically.
In this chapter we will talk about techniques to solve approximately problems in more
realistic situations. There are a number of methods of which we will discuss the only
following: 1. The stationary or time-dependent perturbation method is useful for
evaluating small perturbations of the system, for example, caused by external electric
or magnetic fields; 2. the variational method, which serves to find and improve trial
wavefunctions, the initial shapes of which are generally motivated by the symmetries
of the system; 3. the semi-classical WKB method; 4. and finally the method of selfconsistent fields, which is an iterative method of solving the Schrödinger equation.

6.1
6.1.1

Stationary perturbations
Time-independent perturbation theory

We first introduce time-independent perturbation theory (TIPT) for multilevel systems. We separate the Hamiltonian into an unperturbed part,
Ĥ (0) |ψ (0) i = E (0) |ψ (0) i ,

(6.1)

and perturbations, which are proportional to a small parameters λ,
Ĥ = Ĥ (0) + λĤ (1) + λ2 Ĥ (2) + .. .

(6.2)

The perturbed wavefunctions are,
|ψi = |ψ (0) i + λ|ψ (1) i + λ2 |ψ (2) i + .. ,

(6.3)

E = E (0) + λE (1) + λ2 E (2) + .. .

(6.4)

and the energies

The contributions ∝ λn are the corrections of order n. The equation we need to solve
now is,
Ĥ|ψi = E|ψi .
187

(6.5)

188

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

By inserting all the expansions above and segregating all orders of λk , we find the
following system of equations,
Ĥ (0) |ψ (0) i = E (0) |ψ (0) i

(6.6)

(Ĥ (0) − E (0) )|ψ (1) i = (E (1) − Ĥ (1) )|ψ (0) i

(Ĥ (0) − E (0) )|ψ (2) i = (E (2) − Ĥ (2) )|ψ (0) i + (E (1) − Ĥ (1) )|ψ (1) i
... .

6.1.1.1

|ψn(1) i =
|mihm|ψn(1) i .
(6.7)

We insert this expansion into the second equation (6.6) and multiply with hn|,
X
hn|(Ĥ (0) − En(0) )
|mihm|ψn(1) i = 0 = hn|En(1) − Ĥ (1) |ni .
(6.8)
m

We obtain for the first order correction of the energy of unperturbed states,
En(1) = hn|Ĥ (1) |ni .

(6.9)

As a first example we will calculate in Exc. 6.1.3.1 the first order correction for
the energy of a slightly deformed one-dimensional box potential.
6.1.1.2

First order correction for the wavefunction

Now let us have a look at the first-order correction for the wavefunction again considering the second equation (6.6),
hm|Ĥ (0) − En(0) |ψn(1) i = hm|En(1) − Ĥ (1) |ni .

(6.10)
(1)

When n = m, the left side of this equation disappears. Therefore, En −hn|Ĥ (1) |ni =
(1)
0, and we can restrict to the terms n 6= m discarding the terms in En ,

This procedure simulates the distortion of the state by blending it with other states.
The perturbation induces virtual transitions to other states. The perturbation is large
when the blended levels are close.

189

See Exc. 6.1.3.2. In Exc. 6.1.3.3 we calculate the first order correction due to the
finite extension of the hydrogen nucleus. In Exc. 6.1.3.4 we treat the coupling of the
energy levels of a two-level system as a first order perturbation, and compare the
result with the exact solution. The Stark effect for an electron confined in a box can
be discussed (see Exc. 6.1.3.5) in first order TIPT.
6.1.1.3

correction,

The left-hand side of this equation disappears. Also, on the right-hand side, for

The first term is similar to the first order correction; the eigenvalue of the second
order perturbation calculated in the base of the unperturbed states. The second term
describes the shift of the energies through possible temporary transitions to other
states.
In Exc. 6.1.3.6 we treat a system of three coupled levels up to the second perturbative order. The Stark effect discussed in Exc. 6.1.3.7 needs the TIPT calculation
up to the second order.

6.1.2

TIPT with degenerate states

Exact calculations show that the effect of a perturbation is larger – but finite – for
degenerate states. On the other hand, from the above expressions for the corrections
of both energies and wavefunctions, we would infer that these corrections can become
very large for small perturbations or even diverge.
Fortunately, the fact that every linear combination of degenerate wavefunctions
is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian as well gives us the freedom to choose the
combination, which is most similar to the final form of the perturbed wavefunctions.

190

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

For example, considering a perturbation by a magnetic field it may be advantageous
to expand the spherical functions Ylm on a basis of cylindrical coordinates 1 . We
will see in the following that we can solve both problems, the selection of the initial
combination and the prevention of divergent denominators at once, without explicitly
specifying the expansion.

We consider eigenstates |n, νi with the energy En being r times degenerate with
respect to the quantum number ν, where ν = 1, .., r. All states satisfy

When the perturbation Ĥ (1) is applied, we assume that the state |ψnµ i is distorted

towards the similar state |ψnµ i, and the energy changes from En to Enµ . We now
need the index µ to label the energy, since the degeneracy can be removed by the
perturbation. As before, we write now,

The solution of this secular determinant yields the solicited energies Eµ . Now, the solution of the secular equation (6.24) for each energy value produces those coefficients,
which represent the best linear combinations adapted to the perturbation. Unlike in
previous calculations with degenerate states, here we consider linear combinations of
vectors of the degenerate subspace prior to switching on the perturbation.
In practice, we apply perturbation theory only to the lowest relevant order. That
is, we only calculate the second order correction if first order corrections vanish. One
famous example is the quadratic Stark effect discussed in Sec. 9.3. In the case of
eigenvalues, which are degenerate in the absence of perturbation, the first order will
always produce a remarkable correction, as in the example of the linear Stark effect,
also discussed in Sec. 9.3. For this reason, we need not discuss higher perturbation
orders in the case of degenerate eigenvalues.
Example 33 (Perturbation in a system with two degenerate states): As
an example, we consider the following Hamiltonian,

Variational method

6.2.1

The Rayleigh fraction

Let us assume that we want to calculate the ground state energy Eg of a system
described by a Hamiltonian Ĥ, but we do not know the wavefunction, and we do
not know how to solve the Schrödinger equation. If at least we had a good idea of
the generic form of the solution (Gaussian, sinusoidal, ..), we could choose a trial
function with a free parameter and optimize this parameter minimizing the energy,
which ought to be minimal for the ground state. This is precisely the idea of the
variational method. Note that the variational method only works for the ground
state.
For any function ψ we know that the Rayleigh fraction E satisfies,
Eg ≤

hψ|Ĥ|ψi
≡E ,
hψ|ψi

(6.26)

not only when ψ is the wavefunction of an excited state, but even when it represents
a (imperfect) trial to the ground state. Assuming normalized wavefunctions we can
discard the denominator hψ|ψi = 1. To verify the theorem,
we expand the function ψ
P
into orthonormal (unknown) eigenfunctions, |ψi = n cn |ψn i. Since ψ is normalized,
X
X
1 = hψ|ψi =
hψm |c∗m cn |ψn i =
|cn |2 .

In the same way,
hψ|Ĥ|ψi =

hψm |c∗m Ĥcn |ψn i =

As the ground state is that of the lowest energy, Eg ≤ En , we have demonstrated the
relationship (6.26)

Eg = Eg

In practice, the ansatz ψα for the ground state allows us to calculate an energy

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

In the Excs. 6.2.3.1 and 6.2.3.2 we will approach the fundamental state of a quartic
potential and a harmonic oscillator, respectively, by trying several trial wavefunctions
and optimizing their free parameters.

6.2.2

Rayleigh-Ritz method

A modification of the variational method is the Rayleigh-Ritz method. Here, instead
of using a trial function,
P we use a linear combination of eigenfunctions with variable
coefficients: |ψi =
k ck |ki. These variables are then optimized to minimize the
Rayleigh fraction,

Hence,

The condition for the existence of solutions is that the secular determinant disappears,
0 = det(hq|Ĥ|mi − Ehq|mi) .

(6.34)

The solution of this equation leads to a set of values E, and the lowest value, Emin ,
is the best approximation for the ground state energy. The coefficients of the wavefunction are obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation (6.33) with Emin .
In Exc. 6.2.3.3 we will use the Rayleigh-Ritz method to estimate the effect of a
finite nuclear mass of the hydrogen atom on the energy levels. In Exc. 6.2.3.4 we will
use the Rayleigh-Ritz method to find the maximum number of atoms allowing for a
stable Bose-Einstein condensate made of atoms subject to an attractive interatomic
force.

the maximum number of atoms allowing for a stable condensate. (Note that the
derived minimization condition must be evaluated numerically.)

6.3

WKB approximation

The WKB approximation (from Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) [93, 370, 649] is a method
to find approximate solutions for linear differential equations with spatially variable
coefficients. It is typically used for calculations in quantum mechanics where the
wavefunction is reformulated as an exponential semi-classically expanded function,
and then the amplitude or phase is slowly changed. In the following, we present the
WKB approximation applied to the Schrödinger equation and exemplify it in some
canonical systems.

6.3.1

Starting from the time-independent Schrödinger equation,
−

~2 d2
ψ(x) + V (x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x) ,

and rewrite it as follows,

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

p
with k(x) =
2m[E − V (x)]/~2 . For now, we will restrict ourselves to energies
E > V (x). In this scheme, the wavefunctions are usually complex functions, so that
we can write them in polar coordinates, containing an amplitude A(x) and a phase
φ(x), which are both real numbers:
ψ(x) = A(x)eiφ(x) .

(6.37)

Substituting this function into the Schrödinger equation we obtain a system of coupled
equations in terms of A(x) and φ(x),
h
i
and
(A2 φ0 )0 = 0 .
(6.38)
A00 = A (φ0 )2 − k 2

The equations (6.39) and (6.37) are completely equivalent to the Schrödinger equation.
The second Eq. (6.38) is easy to solve,
C
A= √ 0 ,
φ

(6.39)

being C a real constant. We can not say the same thing about the solution of the first
Eq. (6.38). In order to solve it we are going to use the WKB approach, assuming that
A varies slowly, so the term A00 → 0. By doing this approximation we can rewrite
Eq. (6.39) in this way:
(φ0 )2 = k 2 .
(6.40)
Solving this last expression we obtain two linearly independent solutions, φ0 = ±k.
So we get the expression for the phase:
Z
φ(x) = ± k(x)dx .
(6.41)
We write this indefinite integral, because the constant term can be absorbed by the
constant C. Finally, we obtain the expression for the wavefunction in the WKB
approximation:
R
C
ψ(x) = p
e± |k(x)|dx .
(6.42)
|k(x)|
Here, taking the absolute value of the wavevector, we have already generalized for the
case that the energy E of the particle is lower than the potential V (x) (classically
forbidden region).
Example 34 (WKB approximation): The WKB approach is a semiclassical
method for the solution of the Schrödinger equation that does not require the
potential to be a perturbation of a soluble problem. Instead, it only assumes
that certain classical quantities having the dimension of an action (energy per
time) are much larger than Planck’s constant. Inserting the ansatz
ψ(x) = AeiS(x)/~ ,
into the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation, we find,

Let us start with the right turning point Fig. 6.1(a)]. First, we shift the coordinate

In the vicinity of the turning point we approximate the potential by a straight line
(Taylor series expansion up to first order) with the following functional dependence,
V (x) ≈ E + V 0 (0)x .

(6.44)

The Schrödinger equation for this potential acquires the following format,

having as solution a linear combination of the two solutions of the Airy equation,

well-known system: the harmonic oscillator. We will calculate its energy levels
and the respective eigenfunctions.
Eigenenergies: First, note that for a confining potential, and more specifically
in the region where E ≥ V (x), we have the solutions obtained for the left and

Eigenstates: Now we will calculate the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator. The eigenfunctions were calculated on a computer. The first graph
(Fig. 6.2) compares the first exact excited state with that obtained using the
WKB method.
Note that the WKB approach is very good when x → 0 and x → ∞, regions
where the difference between the oscillator energy and the potential are large
(E  V (x → 0) and E  V (x → ∞)), because in these regions
p the wavelength λ(x) acquires the lowest values, since it is proportional to |1/ E − V (x)|.

that n 6= 0, because the integral (6.54) has to be greater than zero.

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

Figure 6.2: First excited state calculated accurately and through the WKB approximation.
Hence, the spatial region in which the potential needs to be practically constant
is smaller, which explains why the approximation is closer to the exact solution. In the intermediate regions the difference between E and V (x) begins to
decrease, and the WKB approximation delivers its worst results.
As we increase the energy of the harmonic oscillator, the approximation becomes better (for the same reason as discussed in the previous paragraph). The
following graph illustrates this effect for n = 10.

Time-dependent perturbations

Temporal perturbations typically occur when we suddenly switch on an external field
that influences the motion or spin of the particles, or when the field varies over time,
for example, an electromagnetic field. Let us first study a two-level system subject to
a temporal perturbation.

6.4.1

Two-level systems

We write the perturbation as
Ĥ = Ĥ (0) + Ĥ (1) (t) .

(6.55)

As in the case of a stationary perturbation, we write the eigenenergies and -functions
of the unperturbed system as
Ĥ (0) |ni = En |ni .

(6.56)

204

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

Recalling that this stationary Schrödinger equation was obtained from the timedependent Schrödinger equation via a separation ansatz (2.55), the temporal evolution
of these eigenfunctions is given by,
|ψn(0) (t)i = |nie−iEn t/~ .

(6.57)

For small perturbations we can expect that the ansatz,
(0)

(0)

|ψ (1) (t)i = a1 (t)|ψ1 (t)i + a2 (t)|ψ2 (t)i ,

(6.58)

be good. Note that not only do eigenfunctions oscillate, but the coefficients also
depend on time, because the composition of the states can change. The instantaneous
probability of finding the system in state n is |an (t)|2 . Importing the above linear
combination into the Schrödinger equation,

stationary eigenfunctions,
a1 e−ıE1 t/~ Ĥ (1) |1i + a2 e−ıE2 t/~ Ĥ (1) |2i = i~ȧ1 e−ıE1 t/~ |1i + ı~ȧ2 e−ıE2 t/~ |2i , (6.61)
and multiplying this equation with h1|× and h2|×, we find with the abbreviation
~ω0 ≡ E2 − E1 ,

6.4.2

The time-dependent perturbation method

Now let is turn our attention to systems with many levels.

6.4. TIME-DEPENDENT PERTURBATIONS

205

In time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT) we separate the Hamiltonian into
a stationary part and a time-dependent part 7,8 ,
Ĥ(t) = Ĥ (0) + λĤ (1) (t) .

(6.64)

As usual, this Hamiltonian satisfies the Schrödinger equation,
ı~

∂
|ψ(t)i = Ĥ(t)|ψ(t)i .
∂t

(6.65)
(0)

Now we do a unitary transformation into the interaction picture with S(t) = e−ıĤ t/~
substituting |ψ(t)i ≡ S(t)|ψI (t)i and Ĥ (1) (t) ≡ S(t)Ŵ (t)S −1 (t) in the Schrödinger
equation. This procedure removes the stationary part, as shown in Sec. 2.4.4,
i~

∂
|ψI (t)i = λŴ (t)|ψI (t)i .
∂t

(6.66)

If Ŵ (t) were also independent of time, the solution would simply be |ψI (t)i =
e−ıŴ t/~ |ψI (0)i. Otherwise, we integrate the equation,
|ψI (t)i = |ψI (0)i +

or in Blochinzew, p.332ff.
8 Note that by substituting Ŵ by Ĥ (1) , the equation (6.66), i~∂ |ψ (t)i = Ĥ (1) (t)|ψ (t)i, cort I

responds to a first-order perturbative approximation, i.e., the perturbation eigenvalues Ĥ(1) are

The varying potential is considered a perturbation, and a variation of the system’s
state is observed. As the energy is not conserved, [∂t , Ĥ(t)] 6= 0, the time-dependence
is not separable and the system exchanges energy with the potential. In first-order
perturbation theory we only consider weak perturbations, i.e. the initial state is gradually emptied, ai→i (dt) ' ai→i (0) = 1. For an initially empty state the growth is
obviously considerable. For i 6= f we have,
dai→f (t) = ai→f (t + dt) − ai→f (t) =

λ

(6.72)

This formula is nothing more than a generalization of the formula (6.63) obtained
for a two-level system assuming that the initial state does not deplete considerably.
In Exc. 6.4.6.1 we calculate the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator perturbed by a
decaying force.

6.4.3

Specific perturbations

could define the coefficients in Schrödinger’s picture, af ≡ hf |ψi, but this would only introduce a phase factor, ai→f −→ ai→f ei(Ef −Ei )t/~ , which is unimportant for absolute values |ai→f |2 .
This corresponds to a transformation to a rotating system, which will be discussed in Sec. 14.2.1.
11 We use the trigonometric rule sin x = 2 sin x cos x .

t→∞

(6.76)

The δ-function in (6.75) ensures that, for infinitely sharp steps, transitions are impossible, unless the energy of the final state is the same as the one of the initial state.
This points to the fact that infinitely sharp steps are not a realistic physical concept.
In practice, the changes applied to a system are often slow and the observation
times are long, because the frequencies of the transitions are high ωf i /2π ' THz.
Let us assume that the perturbation be switched on within a time constant γ −1 . In
Exc. 6.4.6.2 we will study how the rapidity of a perturbation influences the transition
rate. We will see via a temporal analysis of |ai→f (t)|2 , that for slow variations,
γ  ωf i , the system adiabatically approaches the final situation. For γ ' ωf i , the
system receives a shock and exhibits oscillating transients. For γ > ωf i , we observe
violent oscillations with largest amplitudes.
6.4.3.2

Periodic perturbations

We now consider the case of an oscillatory perturbation, for example an electromagnetic field. In principle, knowledge of the system’s response to periodic perturbations
allows us to treat arbitrary perturbations, since we can expand them in Fourier series.
We first treat transitions between discrete levels, before considering states embedded
in continua,

|ai→f (t)|2 = |Ωf i |2 1 2

(6.79)

4 (ωf i − ω)
This result coincides with the Rabi formula (6.74), except that the energy difference
between the states ωf i is shifted by the frequency of the perturbation ω. The quantity
∆f i ≡ ω − ωf i is called a detuning. The transition probability is maximal, when we
are at resonance, that is ∆f i = 0. In this case,
|ai→f (t)|2 −→ |Ωf i |2 t2 .

(6.80)

This can be seen by expanding the numerator in a Taylor series for small (ωf i − ω)t.
Note, that the probability exceeds 1 for long times, which can not be. In fact, the
restriction to the first order in the Taylor expansion used in the derivation of the last

208

CHAPTER 6. APPROXIMATION METHODS

equation is no longer valid for long times, when (ωf i − ω)t > 1, and we need to take
into account higher orders.
Example 37 (The Rabi formula): Let us now consider a periodic perturbation oscillating at frequency ω = ω0 + ∆, where ∆ is called the detuning from
the resonance ω0 ,
H (1) = −eE(r, t) · r = −eE0 ε̂ cos(kz − ωt) · r .

(6.81)

Then,
h2|H (1) |1i = −eE0 cos(kz − ωt)h2|r|1i = ~Ω cos(kz − ωt) ,

and

(6.83)

ȧ2 = −iΩ∗ a1 eiω0 t cos(kz − ωt) . (6.84)

This results has already been obtained in 2.4.7.1 using a different approach.
When the energies En are degenerate, under the influence of the perturbation,
the populations of the system oscillate with the Rabi frequency Ω. When the
energies are different, the oscillation frequency G is higher, but the amplitude
decreases as well. The initially empty state never reaches unitary population. In
Exc. 6.4.6.3 we calculate the time required to allow the perturbation to invert
the population of a two-level system, in Exc. 6.4.6.4 we study the maximum
achievable inversion as a function of detuning, and in Exc. 6.4.6.5 we analyze
the dynamics of a system subject to sequences of pulses.

Continuous frequency distribution

To derive Eq. (6.79), we considered perturbations with fixed oscillation frequencies. To
handle frequency distributions %(ω), we must generalize this equation by calculating
the integral,

|ai→f (t)|2 = |Ωf i |2 %(ω) 1 2

again using the representation (6.97) of the Dirac function. The approximation
%(ω) = %(ωf i ) can be used if the width of the sinc function is much narrower than
the frequency distribution, which is the case for sufficiently long times, t  π/2∆f i .
12 With

ρ(E) ≡ f ∈F δ(Ef − E) the integral is converted back into a sum.

Numerical methods

The softwares ’Maple’ or ’Mathematics’ are useful for analytical calculations, that
is, multiplying matrices or determining eigenvalues. For numerical calculations the
software ’Matlab’ is more adapted. For example, the time evolution of a Schrödinger
equation,
|ψ(t)i = e−ıĤt/~ |ψ(0)i ,
(6.102)
can be calculated in a single command line using the Matlab ’expm’ function.
When the system varies temporally, Ĥ(t), we may divide time into small units dt
and propagate the wavefunction as,


dt
,
(6.103)
|ψ(t + dt)i = e−ıĤ(t)dt/~ |ψ(t)i ' |ψ(t)i 1 − ı Ĥ
~

continuously reinserting the solution into the equation. This Newton method does not
converge quickly (dt should be chosen small enough, when Ĥ(t) varies rapidly), but
there are other more sophisticated methods like the Runge-Kutta method.
A variation of this method is called steepest descent method. This method is
similar to the Newton Eq. (6.103), but replaces the time dt with an imaginary time.
Thus, the coherent temporal evolution of the Schrödinger equation is replaced by a
dissipative evolution. The loss of energy automatically takes the system to the ground
state. However, in order to preserve the normalization of the wavefunction, it must
be renormalized at each iteration step,
|ψ(t + dt)i
|ψ(t + dt)i → p
.
hψ(t + dt)|ψ(t + dt)i

(6.104)

The method also applies to more complicated equations than the Schrödinger equation, for example, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We will deepen this technique in
Sec. 26.3.3.

Another numerical method often used in quantum mechanics is the method called
the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the wavefunction [441]. This method simulates trajectories of quantum systems treating intrinsic quantum noise as random
processes disrupting the uniformity of the trajectory. The advantage of this method
is that it also applies to dissipative systems.

Transition rates for higher-order perturbations

The evolution from an initial state |ii that the system occupies at time t0 to some final
state |ψi, which may be a superposition, occupied at time t is ruled by the solution
of the Schrödinger equation,
|ψi = e−ıĤ(t−t0 )/~ |ii .

(6.105)

The probability to encounter |ψi in a given state |f i is |hf |ψi|2 , and has the transition
rate is simply the derivative of this. The transition rate out of the initial state into
any other final state is, consequently
1 X d
=
|hf |e−ıĤ(t−t0 )/~ |ii|2 .

Let us now consider a time-independent perturbation in the Schrödinger picture,
Ĥ(t) = Ĥ (0) + Ĥ (1) ,

(6.107)

where the time dependence is entirely left to the wavefunction. Now, we expand the
propagator e−ıĤ(t−t0 ) in a perturbative series 14 . Unfortunately, [Ĥ (0) , Ĥ (1) ] 6= 0, so

Electron spin and the atomic
fine structure
The energy structure of hydrogen calculated by Bohr’s model from the non-relativistic
Hamiltonian agrees very well with the experimental measurements. However, in highresolution experiments, small deviations were observed as energy shifts and splittings
of spectral lines. These deviations, called fine structure, were not predicted by theory,
which suggests that there are weak additional effects that do not strongly affect the
position of the spectral lines but remove the energy degeneracy of the orbital quantum
number `: E = En,` .
As a possible explanation we have the fact that the electrons present relativistic
mass and momentum. In order to estimate the relevance of relativistic corrections
let us estimate the electron velocity in the fundamental hydrogen states given by
E1 = −~2 /2me a2B . Using the definitions of the Bohr radius, aB = 4πε0 ~2 /(me e2 ),
and the fine structure constant

we obtain,

try the approach of inserting the quantum operators into the relativistic energymomentum relation 1 .

This is the Klein-Gordon equation. The stationary solution of this equation is a
spherical wave,

ψ = ψ0 e−2πr/λC ,
(8.7)
r
where λC = h/me c is the Compton wavelength. We show this in Exc. 8.1.5.1. For
example, in the case of heavy bosonic particles, such as a field of π-mesons, ψ is the
Yukawa potential.
In the framework of the standard model, it is believed that matter is composed
of two fundamental types of particles, bosons and fermions. Bosons are exchanged
between fermions conveying the interaction between them. A typical example is
the one of two electrons whose Coulomb interaction is mediated by the exchange
of photons. Bosons obey the Klein-Gordon equation, fermions the Dirac equation
derived in the following section.

8.1.2

The Dirac equation for fermions

In 1928 Paul Dirac, at the age of 26, developed an approach to a relativistic wave equation which differed from the Klein-Gordon equation. Motivated by the observation
that the photon, being the relativistic particle par excellence, obeys a linear energymomentum relation of the form ω = ck, he attempted to derive a linear dispersion
relation in E and p for heavy particles via the following ansatz:
E = α0 me c2 + α1 cpx + α2 cpy + α3 cpz .

We must now ensure that the relativistic energy-momentum condition (8.5) be satisfied.
Example 38 (Derivation of the Dirac equation): Taking the square on the
right-hand side of the equation (8.9),
[α0 me c2 − ıc~(α1 ∂x + α2 ∂y + α3 ∂z )][α0 me c2 − ıc~(α1 ∂x + α2 ∂y + α3 ∂z )]

For this expression to be identical to the relativistic energy-momentum condition
(8.5),
m2e c4 − c2 ~2 [∂x2 + ∂y2 + ∂z2 ] ,
we need to postulate for all i = 0, .., 4, that αi αj + αj αi = 2δij .

Obviously, the condition
[αi , αj ]+ = 2δij

(8.10)

can not be satisfied if the αi are numbers. The idea of Dirac was to interpret the
variables αi as matrices. These matrices act as operators on appropriate states, which
are no longer scalar wavefunctions but vectors. Each component of the vector is a
wavefunction in the usual sense. The Hilbert space is extended to be the product
space of the usual spatial wavefunctions and a finite-dimensional vector space.
Example 39 (Calculation with matrices of operator ): To give an idea of
how the algebra works we consider a general situation. As the operator we
choose the product,

The matrices αi must satisfy the condition (8.10). It is possible to show that this
requires at least four-dimensional matrices of the following form:

Example 40 (Covariant and relativistically invariant form of Dirac’s
equation): To demonstrate its relativistic invariance it is useful to rewrite the
Dirac equation in a way in which time and space appear on equal footings. For
this we introduce new matrices,
γ 0 ≡ α0

γ k = γ 0 αk .

(8.19)

With this, using Einstein’s notation 3 , the Dirac equation (8.13) adopts the
form,
ı~γ µ ∂µ ψ − mcψ = 0 .
(8.20)

The complete system is summarized in the Minkowski metrics of time-space in
the form,
[γ µ , γ ν ]+ = 2η µν ,
(8.21)
for µ, ν = 0, .., 5, that is, all matrices γk anticommute.
The Dirac equation can now be interpreted as an eigenvalue equation, where
the rest mass is proportional to the eigenvalue of a momentum quadrivector,
the proportionality constant being the speed of light:
Pop ψ = mcψ ,
(8.22)

Using ∂ in the Feynman slash notation, which includes the γ-matrices, as well
as a summation over the components of the spinor in the derivative, the Dirac
equation becomes:

ı~∂ ψ − mcψ = 0 .
(8.23)

A fundamental theorem states that, if two distinct sets of matrices are given,
which both satisfy Clifford’s relations, then they are connected to each other by
a similarity transformation:

If, in addition, the matrices are all unitary, as is the case of Dirac’s set, then S
is unitary,
γ 0µ = U † γ µ U .
(8.25)

8.1.2.1

Anti-particles

Disregarding for a moment the non-diagonal matrix, the Dirac equation separates
into two independent equations,

(8.26)

These are eigenenergy equations with the eigenvalues me c2 and −me c2 . The state
with negative energy is interpreted as anti-particle. Therefore, the non-diagonal matrix mixes particles and anti-particles. We will study in Exc. 8.1.5.2 the so-called
Zitterbewegung as a solution of the Dirac equation.
8.1.2.2

Particles and anti-particles in the non-relativistic limit

To reduce the Dirac equation to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, we first
need to get rid of the rest energy. To do so, we separate a fast oscillation, whose
frequency corresponds to the rest mass of the electron via the following ansatz, where
u and v vary slowly in time:


~
−ıω0 t u(r, t)

finally obtaining,

ı~v̇ = c(~σ · p)u − 2me c2 v .

(8.30)

Since u and v only vary slowly in time, the derivatives on the left-hand side are small
quantities. However, the condition that both derivatives must zero is too strong,
because it leads to the trivial solution u = 0 and v = 0. We find the first non-trivial
solution by the condition v̇ = 0. The second equation then becomes,
v=

positronic contributions as it approaches the speed of light. In the ground state of
the hydrogen atom the electron has a velocity of of v = αc ' c/137. That is, the
contribution of the weak components is small, but present.

Example 41 (Vanishing rest mass): Let us note that for the case of vanishing
rest mass, me = 0, the Dirac equation (8.15) dramatically simplifies. Taking the
time derivative of the upper equation (8.15) and inserting the lower equation
(8.15), we find,

In general terms the following holds true: [si , sj ] = ijk ı~sk . It is interesting to compare this with the commutation relation for the orbital angular momentum [ˆli , ˆlj ] =
ijk ı~ˆlk . The coincidence suggests a generalization of the concept of angular momentum: We now call angular momentum operator every three-dimensional vector
operator satisfying this commutation relation 4 . We consider the eigenvalue equation

The eigenvalues are obviously ms = ± 12 . The angular momentum related to the
matrices S is obviously half-integer. We are dealing here with a new type of angular
momentum, which is not included in the usual definition of orbital angular momentum
L = r × p. The new angular momentum is called intrinsic angular momentum or
spin of the particle. The spin represents a new structure or dimension additional to
space comparable to the polarization of light. The photons of a circularly polarized
light beam also contribute to an intrinsic angular momentum, which however in this
case is integer.
In Exc. 8.1.5.3 we will see that neither ˆlz nor ŝz are constants of motion of the
Hamiltonian (8.15), but the sum ĵz ≡ ˆlz + ŝz ,
[ĵz , Ĥ] = 0 .

In atomic physics we are mainly interested in electrons bound to a potential (e.g.,
generated by an atomic nucleus), that is, we must introduce electromagnetic forces
into the Dirac equation. Therefore, we now consider the interaction of a charged

electrostatic potential U , such that the electric and magnetic fields,

called the minimal coupling. We briefly mentioned this already in Sec.2.5.3, and the

we must add the scalar potential qU , and we obtain the Dirac equation for a particle

the Dirac equation can be solved algebraically [180, 250, 255, 223] 6 . The calculation
is more complicated than the resolution of the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen

a+
the gs coefficients,
[αa − a+ (s − j 0 )]fs + [αa− + a(s + j 0 )]gs = 0 .

(8.63)

To obtain the values of the coefficients we consider the boundary conditions.
The functions f~(r) and ~g (r) must go to zero at r = 0, because the functions
~ and χ

~ would otherwise diverge there due to the r−1 term. This means that
there is some smallest s below which the series does not continue. We call this
s0 , and it has the property,
fs0 −1 = gs0 −1 = 0 .

(8.64)

Plugging this into the equations (8.62), we find,
αfs0 + (s0 + j 0 )gs0 = 0

αgs0 − (s0 − j )fs0 = 0 .
Combining these equations we can write the value s0 in a very simple form,
p
s0 = j 02 − α2 .
(8.66)
This places a lower bound on the series. Note that this bound becomes imaginary
if α > j 0 . This will be discussed in more detail shortly.
The upper bound of the series is also useful. It can be shown that the series must
terminate if the energy eigenvalue is to be less than me c2 [180]. The implication
of this result is that if the series terminates at index s1 such that,
fs1 +1 = gs1 +1 = 0 .

The two end points of the series, the indices s0 and s1 are separated by an
integer number of steps. Calling this integer n0 we can write,
p
s1 = n0 + s0 = n0 + j 02 − α2 .

This is the final result quoted for the energy eigenvalues of the hydrogenic atom
by Dirac [180]. It turns out that later developments in the field [250, 255] prefer
to use an equivalent set of quantum numbers that maps more closely to the
familiar ones. The number j 0 is closely related to the total angular momentum
quantum number j. j 0 has the range 1, 2, 3, while j has the range 21 , 23 , 52 . It
is natural, and in fact correct, to make the identifications,

The energy predicted by the Sommerfeld fine-structure formula (8.74) depends on
two quantum numbers. The degeneracy of the orbital angular momentum j is lifted,
and the new quantum number besides the main quantum number n is that of the
total angular momentum j. The intransparent expression can be expanded by α,

The second term reproduces the energy of Bohr’s model, but there are correction
terms proportional to α4 . We will show in Secs. 8.1.4, that the energy levels, called
fine structure, result from several relativistic corrections of different origins.
In the expression (8.75) for the electron energy in the Coulomb potential, the last
term is positive and proportional to 1/n4 . It describes relaxation of the binding due
to the contribution of weak components. The term containing the quantum number
j is called the spin-orbit coupling. To better understand this contribution we must
first analyze more deeply the matrices ~σ .

8.1.4

The Pauli equation

When we calculated the electron’s energy in the Coulomb potential (8.86), we only
considered the electrostatic potential of the nucleus, letting the potential vector A be
zero. As long as we do not apply an external magnetic field this is correct, because the
internal magnetism of the atom is already completely enclosed in the Dirac equation.
On the other hand, we know that the atom contains moving charges, that is, currents
which generate magnetic fields 8 . Furthermore, the spins of the electron and of the
proton produce magnetic moments, which ought to interact with the magnetic fields.
Hence, the existence of magnetic effects in an atom is to be expected.
These magnetic effects can be discussed in a more transparent way applying a
Schrödinger-like equation with minimal coupling to electromagnetic fields (8.44) to
~ This Schrödinger-like equation can be obtained from
a two-component spinor φ.
Dirac’s equation (8.76) via a stronger non-relativistic approximation, which consists
in completely neglecting the weak component [E 0 − qU (r)]~
χ. On the other hand, we
allow for the existence of magnetic fields via the substitution p → ~π . The equation

The Pauli equation serves for a classical (non-relativistic) approach to the electron’s spin-orbit coupling, as we will see below and in the discussion of the fine
structure in Sec. 8.2.2.
8 The spin of the electron does not generate a magnetic field, in contrast to the angular momentum
caused by its orbital motion. It only interacts with the environment through the requirement of
symmetrization for being a fermion.

The resulting interaction energy coincides, apart from a factor 12 [613], with the one

due to the necessity to transform back into the inertial system of the nucleus. This

which is not trivial with electron continuously changing its propagation direction on
its circular orbit. The transformation introduces the additional factor of 21 10 .

8.1.5.2

Ex: Zitterbewegung

Zitterbewegung is a hypothetical rapid motion of elementary particles, in particular
electrons, that obey the Dirac equation. The existence of such motion was first
proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in 1930 as a result of his analysis of the wave packet
solutions of the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons in free space, in which an
interference between positive and negative energy states produces what appears to be
a fluctuation (at the speed of light) of the position of an electron around the median,
with a frequency of 2me c2 /~, or approximately 1.6 · 1021 rad/s. For the hydrogen
atom, the Zitterbewegung produces the Darwin term which plays the role in the fine
structure as a small correction of the energy level of the s-orbitals.
Use the Heisenberg equation to derive, from Dirac’s Hamiltonian, equations of motion
~ Solve the equation of motion
for the position operator r̂ and the ’velocity operator’ α̂.
and identify the Zitterbewegung.
10 This is a kinematic effect in space-time: the Lorentz transformations for systems moving with
non-collinear velocities can not simply be concatenated, but must be rotated, too [223, 322].

Fine structure of hydrogen-like atoms via TIPT

The wave equation that simultaneously satisfies the requirements of quantum mechanics and special relativity is the Dirac equation. In free space including electromagnetic
interactions it describes all massive particles of semi-integer spin with parity as a symmetry, such as electrons and quarks. It was the first theory to fully explain special
relativity in the context of quantum mechanics. The Dirac equation describes the fine
structure of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous manner. The equation
also implied the existence of a new form of matter, antimatter, previously unsuspected and unobserved. The equation also justifies a posteriori the introduction of
spinors, that is, of the vector wavefunctions introduced by Pauli in a heuristic way.
We have seen in the last section that, in the limit of high but non-relativistic velocities, the Dirac equation adopts the form of a Schrödinger equation with the modified
Hamiltonian (8.86),
Ĥ = Ĥ0 + Ĥrl + Ĥ`s + Ĥdw + Ĥlamb

are, in fact, equivalent.

Correction for relativistic velocities

Due to the degeneracy of these states, it would be appropriate to use perturbation
theory with degenerate states. However, as Ĥrl only depends on spatial coordinates
commuting with l and s, the degeneracy is not very important, since Ĥrl is already

8.2.2

Correction due to spin-orbit coupling

The second correction, Ĥ`s in the expression (8.109), called spin-orbit interaction, is
a relativistic correction due to the fact that the electron moves rapidly within the
electrostatic field E~ generated by the nucleus. Considering the fundamental orbit

Example 44 (Classical derivation of the spin-orbit interaction): In the
following, we will derive the expression from classical arguments borrowed from
electrodynamic theory. Seen from the rest system of the electron being at position x = 0, it is the proton that orbits around the electron. This orbit creates
a current, −j(r0 ), which generates a magnetic field. Following the Biot-Savart’s

The advantage of introducing the potential V is, that this expression also holds

We may again consider the energy term V`s as a small perturbation, and calculate
it using unperturbed wavefunctions,
∆E`s = hn, `, s, m` , ms |V`s |n, `, s, m` , ms i = hn, `|ξ(r)|n, `ih`, s, m` , ms |s·l|`, s, m` , ms i .
(8.126)
Assuming a Coulombian potential, we first look at the radial part (8.123), which can
easily be calculated using the formulae (4.53),
hn, `|ξ(r)|n, `i =

(8.127)

To diagonalize the angular part of the Hamiltonian, we need the common wavefunctions of l2 and l · s. We can rewrite the coupling term as:
l · s = 12 (j2 − l2 − s2 ) .

(8.128)

In the common eigensystem of j2 , l2 , and s2 the Hamiltonian, therefore, is diagonal.
We know the basis of this system from the theory of the addition of angular momenta.
The states of the basis are linear combinations of the functions |n, `, m` , ms i. Since
the spins precess around each other, `z and sz are not good observables, the noncoupled base is not appropriate. But s2 , l2 , and j2 are good observables. In the
coupled basis {n, (`, s)j, mj },
hn, (`, s)j, mj |s · l|n, (`, s)j, mj i =

~2
2 [j(j

+ 1) − `(` + 1) − s(s + 1)] .

(8.129)

Since j = ` ± 1/2, we find that every level splits into two levels, one with the energy
En` +`ζn` and the degeneracy 2`+2 and the other with the degeneracy En` −(`+1)ζn`
with the degeneracy 2`, where we introduced the abbreviation,
ζn` ≡

~2
2 hξ(r)i

.

(8.130)

All in all, we get an energy correction due to the spin-orbit interaction of,
∆E`s = −En (Zα)2

j(j + 1) − `(` + 1) − 43
.
2n`(` + 1/2)(` + 1)

(8.131)

Note, that the coupling l · s lifts the degeneracy with respect to l, but not with respect
to `z (see Fig. 8.1). As we have already seen in Exc. 8.1.5.6, in the presence of an
energy associated with the coupling l · s, only the total angular momentum l + s is a
constant of motion.

8.2.3

Non-local electron-core interaction

Let us now discuss the third correction in the expression (8.109). The electron-nucleus
interaction that we have considered so far is local, that is, the interaction at the point r
sensed by the electron depends essentially on the field at that point in space. However,
when relativistic theory is correctly applied, the electron-nucleus interaction becomes
non-local, and the electron is then affected by all values of the nuclear field in a

248

CHAPTER 8. ELECTRON SPIN AND THE ATOMIC FINE STRUCTURE

region around r 11 . The size of this region is of the order of the Compton wavelength
of the electron, λC /2π ≡ ~/me c. This correction was introduced by Sir Charles
Galton Darwin through a substitution in the Dirac equation that solved the problem
of normalization of the wavefunction.
Imagine that instead of the potential V (r), the potential of the electron is given
by the integral,
Z
f (r0 )V (r + r0 )d3 r0 ,
(8.132)
where f (r0 ) is a radially symmetric and normalized density-type function that takes
significant values only in the vicinity of r within a volume (λC /2π)3 centered at r0 = 0.
Expanding the potential V (r + r0 ) near the origin,
V (r + r0 ) = V (r) + [r0 · ∇r ]V (r) +

1 0
2! [r

· ∇r ]2 V (r) + ... ,

(8.133)

and inserting into the integral,

coincidentally agrees with the corrections of Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld.

CHAPTER 8. ELECTRON SPIN AND THE ATOMIC FINE STRUCTURE

j = 5/2. For large n or j the fine structure disappears. The new energy scheme is
shown in Fig. 8.1. We note that, taking into account all relativistic corrections (but
without the Lamb shift), we still have a partial degeneracy of the quantum number j.
For example, the states 2 s1/2 and 2 p1/2 have the same energy. This is a particularity
of the hydrogen atom.

8.2.5

Lamb shift

Only remains to discuss the fourth correction, Ĥlamb in the expression (8.6). The
origin of the Lamb shift lies in quantum electrodynamics. Being due to the quantum
nature of the electromagnetic field, this correction is not predicted within the Dirac
equation.
We may imagine the Coulomb force between charged particles being mediated by
a continuous exchange of virtual photons. But each isolated charge also continuously
emits and reabsorbs virtual photons, with the result that the position of the electron
is smeared over a region of 0.1 fm. This reduces the overlap between the electronic
orbits and the nucleus. Hence, the Lamb shift causes corrections that are stronger
for small n and small `. For example in hydrogen, the 2p1/2 is 4.4 · 10−6 eV = 1 GHz
below the 2s1/2 (see Fig. 8.1).

8.2.6

Exercises

8.2.6.1

Ex: The Darwin term

Show that the expressions for the Darwin correction (8.86) and (8.109) are equivalent.

8.3

Hyperfine structure

Rutherford’s measurements suggested a point-like and infinitely heavy atomic nucleus. In fact, the mass is finite and the nuclear charge is distributed over a finite
volume and often in a non-isotropic manner, which leads to multipolar interactions
with the electrons. In addition, many nuclei have a spin that can interact with the
magnetic moment of the electrons. The energy corrections due to these effects are
called hyperfine structure 13 .
Because many of the following considerations will remain valid for many-electron
systems to be discussed later, we will switch to a notation denoting by L the total
orbital angular momentum of the electronic shell, S the total spin of the electronic
shell, and J the total angular momentum of the electronic shell, remembering that
for hydrogen S = ~2 ~σ .

8.3.1

Coupling to the nuclear spin

8.3.1.1

Dipole moment of the nuclear spin

The nucleus may also have an angular momentum interacting with the angular momentum of the electrons. However, the momentum depends inversely on the masses.
13 See

[123] p. 1229 and [626] p. 23 for further reading.

8.3. HYPERFINE STRUCTURE

251

That is, the angular momentum of the nucleus is µN /µB = me /mp ' 10−3 times
smaller, where µN = ~e/2mp is an abbreviation called nuclear magneton. Thus, we
can assume that the interaction between the nucleus and the electron will not interfere with the L · S-coupling between the orbital angular momentum and the spin of
the electron. The spin of the nucleus will be oriented along the total momentum of
the electrons J. However, this interaction will have the ability to lift the hydrogen
degeneracy, even though the splitting will only be hyperfine. Indeed, the order of
magnitude of hyperfine splitting is 10−6 eV.
Analogously to the expressions (8.94) and (8.97), we write the dipole moment of
the nucleus,

8.3.1.2

Hyperfine splitting

In the derivation of the Pauli equation (8.90) from the Dirac equation (8.77) we
discarded non-relativistic terms and reintroduced electronic spin-orbit coupling by
hand allowing for A(r, t) 6= 0. By an analogous calculation directly applied to the
Dirac equation we may unravel the hyperfine structure. Instead of setting the vector
potential to A(r, t) = 0, as we did in (8.46), we now generalize the Dirac equation

inserting the expressions (8.97) and (8.143). The first term gives the energy of the
nuclear dipole in the field due to the electronic orbital angular momentum. The
second term gives the energy of the ’finite distance’ interaction of the nuclear dipole
with the field due to the electron spin magnetic moments. The final term, often known
as the Fermi contact term relates to the direct interaction of the nuclear dipole with
the spin dipoles and is only non-zero for states with a finite electron spin density at
the position of the nucleus (those with unpaired electrons in s-subshells).
We now discuss the two cases in which L = 0 or L 6= 0 separately in the following
subsections [123, 537, 322].
8.3.1.3

Orbital angular momentum L = 0

For vanishing orbital angular momenta, L = 0, we only need to consider the contribution ĤSI . Furthermore, this contribution will be dominated by the Dirac term,
because the s-orbitals have a high probability at the nuclear region, but fall off quickly
at larger distances. Hence,

8.3.1.4

Orbital angular momenta L 6= 0

In the case L 6= 0 both contributions, ĤSI and ĤLI have to be considered, however,
we may neglect the Dirac term, because the orbitals with orbital angular momentum
have vanishing probabilities at the nuclear region. Combining the two terms (8.150)

not of Jz . We can derive the following interval rule,
∆EF +1 − ∆EF = AJ (F + 1) .

(8.165)

Besides the magnetic interaction between the angular momenta of the nucleus
and the electronic shell there is an interaction between the nucleus, when it is not
spherically symmetric, and the shell. This interaction causes deviations from the
interval rule and an additional splitting of the hyperfine states.

8.3.2

Electric quadrupole interaction

corrections that are called quadrupolar interaction. The starting point is,

that a nucleus with I = 0 or I = 21 has no quadrupole moment, BJ = 0. Also for
J = 21 there will be no contribution.
Joining the contributions J · I of Eq. (8.164) and the quadrupolar contribution

Ex: Two particles

Consider a two-particle system of masses µ1 and µ2 , exposed to a central potential
V (r) and an interaction potential V (|r1 − r2 |) which only depends on the distance
between the particles. The Hamiltonian of the system in the interaction representation
~2
is H = H1 + H2 + V (|r1 − r2 |) with H` = − 2µ
∇2` + V (r` ), ` = 1, 2, ... Show that the
`
individual angular momenta L` are not, in general, constants of the motion, unlike
the total angular momentum L = L1 + L2 .

8.4

Exotic atoms

’Normal’ atoms consist of a nucleus made of protons and neutrons and an electronic
shell. But other two-particle systems are possible, e.g. where the nucleus or electron
is replaced by another hadron or lepton (anti-proton, positron, muon, etc.). Such a
system is called exotic atom. Atoms in Rydberg states also belong to this category.

8.4.1

Positronium and muonium

Positronium (e+ e− ) is a hydrogen-like system consisting of leptons, that is, an electron
and a positron, which is the antiparticle of the electron. The muonium (µ+ e− ) is
similar to positronium, except that here the positron is replaced by a muon whose
mass is mµ+ = 207me . Leptons are, according to the present understanding, particles
without internal structure. Both systems are unstable: the two particles annihilate
each other producing γ-photons. The energy levels and orbits of the two particles
are similar to that of the hydrogen atom. However, because of the reduced mass, the
frequencies of the spectral lines are less than half of the corresponding hydrogen lines.
The fundamental state of positronium, like that of hydrogen, has two possible
configurations depending on the relative orientation of the electron and positron spins.

258

CHAPTER 8. ELECTRON SPIN AND THE ATOMIC FINE STRUCTURE

The singlet state with antiparallel spins (S = 0, Ms = 0) is known as para-positronium
(p-Ps) and denoted by 1 S0 . It has an average lifetime of
τ=

2~
= 124.4 ps
me c2 α5

(8.170)

and decays preferably in two gamma rays with energy of 511 keV each (in the centerof-mass). The triplet state with parallel spins (S = 1, Ms = −1, 0, 1) is known as
ortho-positronium (o-Ps) and denoted as 3 S1 . It has an average life of 138.6 ns, and
the most common form of decay produces three photons. Other forms of decay are
negligible. For example, the decay channel producing five photons is 10−6 times less
likely. Measurements of these lifetimes and the positronium energy levels have been
used in precision tests of quantum electrodynamics.
While the precise calculation of the positronium energy levels is based on the
Bethe-Salpeter equation, the similarity between positronium and hydrogen allows for
an approximate estimate. In this approach, the energy levels are suppodsed to be
different from those of hydrogen because of the difference in the value of the reduced
mass µ, used in the energy equation. Since µ = me /2 for positronium, we have

A di-positronium molecule, that is, a system of two bound positronium atoms,
has already been observed. Positronium in high energy states has been conjectured
to become the dominant form of atomic matter in the universe in the very distant
future if the proton decay becomes tangible.

8.4.2

Hadronic atoms

In contrast to leptons (such as the electron e− , the positron e+ and the muons µ+
and µ− ) that participate only in electromagnetic interactions and weak interactions,
hadrons also participate in strong (nuclear type) interactions. There are two types of
hadrons, baryons (such as the proton p and antiproton p̄, the neutron n and antineutron n̄, hyperons Σ, Ξ, ...) that have semi-integer spin and behave like fermions and
mesons (like the π-meson, K-meson, ...) that have an integer spin. Every negatively
charged hadron can be used to form a hydrogen-type hadronic atom. These systems
contain a nucleus and negative hyperon and are known as hyperonic atoms. All of
these are unstable and due to the fact that they have a sufficiently long lifetime, some
of their spectral lines have now been observed.
Since the hadrons interact strongly with the nucleus, the theory developed for hydrogen systems (in which only exist Coulomb interaction) can not be directly applied.
In this way the values shown in Tab. 8.3 give only an estimate of the ’radius’ and the
ionization potential of the hadronic atoms pπ − , pκ− , pp̄ and pΣ− .

8.4.3

Muonic hydrogen

The muon mass is mµ = 207me . When a muon is attached to a proton we have

and the binding energy and the energies of excitation are greater for the same reason.
F.ex. while for H = p+ e− the transition 2S − 2P1/2 is at 10 eV , 121 nm, for p+ µ−
it is at 1900 eV. Muonic atoms are interesting because they have amplified Lamb
shifts, hyperfine interactions, and quantum electrodynamical corrections. Therefore,
the displacement due to the finite distribution of charges in the proton rp = 0.8 fm
should influence the spectrum. While in p+ e− the 2S level is shifted upward by the
Lamb shift by a value of 4.4 × 10−6 eV, in p+ µ− it is shifted down by a value of
0.14 eV. In Exc. 8.4.5.2 we calculate the spectrum of the muonic hydrogen and in
Exc. 6.1.3.3 we compare the energy corrections due to the finite extension of the nuclei
for muonic and for standard hydrogen in first order TIPT.

8.4.4

Rydberg atoms

An atom excited to a state whose main quantum number is very high is called Rydberg
atom. These atoms have a number of peculiar properties, including high sensitivity to
electric and magnetic fields, long decay times, and wavefunctions that approximate
classical electron orbits. The inner electrons protect the outer electron from the
electric field of the nucleus such that, from a distance, the electric potential looks
identical to that seen by the electron of a hydrogen atom.
Despite its flaws, Bohr’s atom model is useful in explaining these properties. In
Exc. 1.1.6.6 we derive Bohr’s expression for the orbital radius in terms of the principal
quantum number n:
4π0 n2 ~2
r=
.
(8.172)
e2 m
Thus, it is clear why Rydberg atoms have peculiar properties: the radius goes as n2
(such that for example the state with n = 137 of hydrogen has a radius of ∼ 1 mm)
and the geometric cross section goes as n4 . Thus, Rydberg atoms are extremely large,
with loosely bound valence electrons that are easily perturbed or ionized by collisions
or external fields.
Since the binding energy of a Rydberg electron is proportional to 1/r, and therefore
falls as 1/n2 , the spacing between energy levels falls as

leading to less and less spaced levels. These Rydberg states form the Rydberg series.

Production of Rydberg atoms

In the hydrogen atom only the ground state (n = 1) is actually stable. Other states
must be excited by various techniques such as electron impact or charge exchange. In
contrast to these methods, which produce a distribution of excited atoms at various
levels, the optical excitation method allows to produce specific states, but only for
alkali metals whose transitions fall into frequency regimes which are accessible to
lasers.
8.4.4.3

Potential in a Rydberg atom

The valence electron in a Rydberg atom with Z protons in the nucleus and Z − 1
electrons in closed layers sees a spherically symmetric Coulomb potential:
Ucou = −

e2
.
4πε0 r

(8.177)

The similarity of the effective potential ’seen’ by the outer electron and the authentic
hydrogen potential suggests a classical treatment within the planetary model. There
are three notable exceptions:
 An atom can have two (or more) electrons in highly excited states with comparable orbital radii. In this case, the electron-electron interaction gives rise to
a significant deviation from the hydrogen potential. For an atom in a multiple
Rydberg state the additional term Uee includes a sum over each pair of highly
excited electrons:
e2 X
1
Uee =
.
(8.178)
4πε0 i<j |ri − rj |

8.4. EXOTIC ATOMS

261

 If the valence electron has very low angular momentum (interpreted classically
as an extremely eccentric elliptical orbit), it can pass close enough to the nucleus
to polarize it, giving rise to an additional term,

Upol = −

e2 αd
.
(4πε0 )2 r4

(8.179)

 If the outer electron penetrates the inner electronic shells, it sees more of the
charge of the nucleus and therefore feels a larger force. In general, the modification of the potential energy is not simple to calculate and should be based on
some knowledge of the nucleus’ geometry.

In hydrogen the binding energy is given by:
EB = −

E1
.
n2

(8.180)

The binding energy is weak at high values of n, which explains the fragility of the
Rydberg states that can easily be ionized, e.g. by collisions.
Additional terms modifying the potential energy of a Rydberg state require the
introduction of a quantum defect, δ`, in the expression for the binding energy:
EB = −

E1
.
(n − δ` )2

(8.181)

The long lifetimes of Rydberg states with high orbital angular momentum can be
explained in terms of overlapping wavefunctions. The wavefunction of an electron in
a state with high ` (large angular momentum, ’circular orbit’) has little overlap with
the wavefunctions of the internal electrons and therefore stays relatively unperturbed.
Also, the small energy difference between adjacent Rydberg states decreased the decay
rate according to the result (13.37).
8.4.4.4

Rydberg atoms in external fields

The large distance between the electron and ionic nucleus in a Rydberg atom gives
rise to an extremely large electric dipole moment d. There is an energy associated
~ known as Stark shift,
with the presence of an electric dipole in an electric field E,
ES = −d · E~ .

(8.182)

Depending on the sign of the projection of the dipole moment onto the vector of the
local electric field, the energy of a state increases or decreases with the intensity of the
field. The narrow spacing between adjacent levels n in the Rydberg series means that
the states can approach degeneracy even for relatively weak fields. Theoretically, the
force of the field in which a level crossing would occur (assuming no coupling between
the states) is given by the Inglis-Teller limit,
FIT =

e
.
12πε0 a20 n5

(8.183)

In hydrogen the pure Coulomb potential does not couple the Stark states of an n
level, which results in a real crossover. In other elements, deviations from the ideal
1/r-potential allow for avoided crossings.

Atoms with spin in external

The atomic fine structure was derived in the last chapter under the assumption that
all electric and magnetic fields arise from the motion and spin of the electrons in the
atomic shell and the nuclear spin. In this chapter, we will extend the treatment to
include the reaction of the electrons to external electrostatic or electromagnetic fields.
In this context, we will discuss the Zeeman and the Stark effect.

Charged particles in electromagnetic fields

9.1.1

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of charged particles

A charge subject to an electromagnetic field feels the Lorentz force,

F = q E~ + q ṙ × B
where

∂A
E~ = −∇Φ −
∂t

and

~ =∇×A ,
B

(9.1)

(9.2)

where Φ and A are called scalar and vector potential, respectively.
It is important to realize here, that the momentum p not only involves the momentum of the particle mv, but the field also carries a momentum qA(r). As we
learned in electrodynamics it is possible to derive this force from a Lagrangian for the
electronic motion,
m
L(ri , ṙi ) = ṙ2 − qΦ(r) + q ṙ · A(r) .
(9.3)

With this aim we first determine the momentum by,
pi =

(9.8)

where the last step of the derivation will be shown in the Exc. 9.1.3.1 using the
Coulomb gauge ∇ · A = 0.

9.1.2

Minimal coupling

Note that the same result (9.6) can be obtained by a canonical substitution,
mv −→ p − qA

and

H −→ H + qΦ .

(9.9)

This substitution rule, called minimal coupling, can be applied in quantum mechanics,
mv̂ −→ −i~∇ − qA

and

Ĥ −→ Ĥ + qΦ .

(9.10)

In the case of the electron (q = −e) trapped in a central Coulomb potential

The fourth term called diamagnetic term is quadratic in A and usually so small
that it can be neglected. The second and third terms describe the interaction of the
electron through its momentum p̂ with the potential vector A produced by magnetic
moments inside the atom or outer magnetic fields. Within the Coulomb gauge we
have (∇ · A)ψ = (A · ∇)ψ + ψ(∇ · A) = (A · ∇)ψ, such that,

that the Hamiltonian (9.11) has been obtained from a gauge transformation in
(2.204). With the particular choice for the gauge field,
χ(r, t) ≡ −A(r, t) · r ,
assuming that the potential only weakly varies in space, such that,

Interaction with magnetic fields
Normal Zeeman effect of the fine structure

The dipole moments of atoms can interact with external magnetic fields. The interaction leads to a shift of levels, which depends on the magnetic quantum number.

CHAPTER 9. ATOMS WITH SPIN IN EXTERNAL FIELDS

Anomalous Zeeman effect

The anomalous Zeeman effect occurs when the ensemble of electrons has a spin. Using
the already known expressions for the dipole moments of the orbital momentum and
the spin of the electron, we obtain for the magnetic dipole moment,

parallel to the total momentum, J = L + S.
When the magnetic field is weak, Vls  Vzee (B), the total momentum J will be a
good observable. Therefore, we must first project the momenta L and S onto J,

∆Epb (B) = −µB (mL + 2mS )B .

(9.25)

This is the Paschen-Back effect.
The derivations we have made so far have focused on simple situations well described by CSCOs in various coupling schemes. The projections on the different
quantization axes [the total spin (9.18) in the Zeeman case or the applied magnetic
field (9.23) in the Paschen-Back case] ensure that the Hamiltonians Vls and Vzee (B) in
these CSCOs are described by diagonal matrices. However, in regimes intermediate
between Zeeman and Paschen-Back, Vls ' Vzee (B), it is generally not possible to find
a diagonal representation.
In order to calculate the energy spectrum in intermediate regimes we must, therefore, determine all the components of the matrix,

Zeeman effect of the hyperfine structure

When the energy of the interaction with the magnetic field is comparable to the
hyperfine interactions, but much weaker than that of the fine interactions, the fields
do not disturb the coupling between the total electronic momentum J and the spin
of the nucleus I. Hence, J, I, F, and mF are good quantum numbers. Therefore, to
calculate the interaction energy,

Now, in large molecules the most electrons are paired, such that Ĵ = 0. In that
case, we are left with the interaction between the nuclear spin and the applied

∆Enmr (B) = µK gI mI B ,
(9.42)
where the g-factor of the nucleus gI must be looked up in data tables. This

large variety of applications in spectroscopy and imaging.

Hyperfine structure in the intermediate field regime

Knowing the dipolar magnetic AJ and quadrupolar BJ interval factors, it is possible
to calculate the Zeeman shift of the hyperfine structure in magnetic fields intermediate
between the Zeeman and Paschen-Back regimes. For this, we must determine all the
components of the matrix Vhf s + Vzee (B) and calculate the eigenvalues. The relevant
terms of the Eqs. (8.169) and the Eq. (9.36) are,

The operator p̂y commutes with this Hamiltonian, since the y operator is absent due
to the choice of the gauge. Thus, the operator p̂y can be replaced by its eigenvalue

To find the energies, we note that the translation of the potential of the harmonic
oscillator does not affect the energies. The energies of this system are therefore
identical to those of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator,


(9.55)

for n ≥ 0. Since the energy does not depend on the quantum number ky , we will
have degeneracy. To derive the wavefunctions, we remember that p̂y commutes with
the Hamiltonian. Then the wavefunction splits into a product of eigenstates of the
momentum in y-direction and eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator |φn i shifted by a
value x0 in x-direction:
Ψ(x, y) = eıky y φn (x − x0 ) .
(9.56)
That is, the state of the electron is characterized by two quantum numbers, n and ky .
Each set of wavefunctions with the same n is called Landau level. Effects due
to Landau levels are only observed, when the average thermal energy is lower than
the separation of the energy levels, which means that low temperatures and strong
magnetic fields are required. Each Landau level is degenerate, because of the second
quantum number ky , which can adopt the values,

Integer and fractional quantum Hall effect

In general, Landau levels are observed in electronic systems with Z = 1 and S = 1/2.
As the magnetic field increases, more and more electrons can fit a certain Landau
level. The occupation of the highest Landau level ranges from entirely full to entirely
empty, leading to oscillations in various electronic properties (see de Haas-van Alphen
effect, Shubnikov-de Haas effect and quantum Hall effect. The most direct observation

Interaction with electric fields
Stark Effect

Electric fields interact with the electrons of the atom. Describing the atom by its
dipole moment, according to (9.13), the interaction energy is,
V̂stark = −d̂ · E~ .

(9.65)

This is the Stark effect. This effect is usually weak, and its observation requires strong
fields or high spectral resolution. Stationary perturbation theory TIPT gives,
Z
En(1) = hψn(0) | − d̂ · E|ψn(0) i = eE~z ·
z|ψn(0) |2 d3 r = 0 .
(9.66)
R3

This only applies when the states have well-defined parity and are NOT degenerate
in `. When they ARE degenerate in `, which is the case of hydrogen, the states have
no defined parity. For example, the states s and p contributing to the same state
|ψn,j i have different parities. In this case, the condition (9.66) does not have to be
satisfied, and the first perturbation order yields a value. This is the case of the linear
Stark effect. In the Excs. 9.3.2.1 and 9.3.2.2 we explicitly calculate the Stark energy
shift for a hydrogen atom subject to an electric field.
Other atoms do not have this degeneracy, and we must calculate the quadratic

Atoms with many electrons
10.1

Symmetrization of bosons and fermions

Quantum mechanics must be formulated in a way to avoid any possibility of distinguishing identical particles. However, the language of mathematics automatically
assigns a particle to a wavefunction; for example, ψa (x1 ) is the wavefunction a of
particle 1 and ψb (x2 ) the wavefunction b of particle 2. In the absence of interactions,
the total wavefunction, Ψ = ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ), solves the Schrödinger equation of two
particles. Now, by changing the coordinates of the particles we get a different state
Ψ0 = ψa (x2 )ψb (x1 ) 1 . This erroneously suggests that the wavefunction of a particle plays the role of a label (or ’soul’) characterizing the particle beyond its set of
quantum numbers. Why this is a problem, we will see in the following example 2 .
Example 48 (Indistinguishability of particles): We consider a system of
two non-interacting spinless particles in an infinite potential well. The total
wavefunction is,
Ψ(1,2) ≡ ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ) = C cos

For observable quantities, such as |Ψ(1,2) |2 , we must ensure, |Ψ(1,2) |2 = |Ψ(2,1) |2 ,
that is,

ψa∗ (x1 )ψb (x1 )dx1 ψb∗ (x2 )ψa (x2 )dx2 = δna ,nb .

2 Ultimately, all this is simply a consequence of the uncertainty principle, which forbids us to
specify a wavefunction as a function of two non-commuting coordinates: We have to choose one
coordinate on which the wavefunction depends and treat the other as a quantum number, for example, ψk (r) = eik·r or ψn (x) = cos nπx
. When we now exchange the coordinates of two particles
L
without changing their quantum numbers, we get obviously different states. In classical physics, the
wavefunction of a particle would be written ψ(x, p). If two classical particles are not distinct by any
other mean, an exchange of all their coordinates would reproduce exactly the same state.

281

282

CHAPTER 10. ATOMS WITH MANY ELECTRONS
but this is not valid for na 6= nb . If na = nb , we have ψa = ψb . That is, the
particles stay in the same state, and we do not need to worry about indistinguishability:
Ψ(2,1) = ψa (x2 )ψb (x1 ) = Ψ(1,2)

and

Ea,b = Eb,a .

However, the fact that this state is never observed with two electrons shows,
that theory must be corrected to allow a true description of reality. Will deepen
this argument in Exc. 10.1.3.1.

We need to construct the total wavefunction in another way. Let us consider linear
combinations of Ψ(1,2) ,
ΨS,A ≡

√1 (Ψ(1,2)
2

± Ψ(2,1) ) =

√1
2

[ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ) ± ψa (x2 )ψb (x1 )] .

(10.2)

This symmetrized wavefunction (or anti-symmetrized) represents a trick to eradicate
the label sticking to the particles. For, under position exchange described by the
operator Px ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ) ≡ ψa (x2 )ψb (x1 ), the (anti-)symmetrized functions behave
like 3 ,
Px ΨS,A = ±ΨS,A
while
Px Ψ(1,2) = Ψ(2,1) 6= ∓Ψ(1,2) .
(10.3)
The (anti-)symmetrized function solves the Schrödinger equation, as well. As [Ĥ, Px ] =
0, we can say that the system exhibits an exchange symmetry or exchange degeneracy
upon particle exchange. Observables such as Ψ∗S,A ΨS,A stay conserved, for example,
the probability

does not change, when we exchange x1 for x2 . For x1 = x2 , we observe,
|ΨS,A |2 = |ψa (x)ψb (x)|2 ± |ψa (x)ψb (x)|2 .

(10.5)

That is, for a symmetric system, the probability of finding two particles at the same
location is doubled, whereas for an anti-symmetric system, this probability is zero.
Wolfgang Pauli showed that the (anti-)symmetric character is related to the spin
of the particles. Particles with integer spin called bosons must be symmetric. Particles with semi-integer spin called fermions must be anti-symmetric. Electrons are
fermions. Therefore, in an atom, they can not be in the same state (location), but
must be distributed over a complicated shell of orbitals. We note, that this applies
not only to elementary particles, but also to composed particles such as, for example, atoms. We will determine in Exc. 10.1.3.2 the bosonic or fermionic character of
several atomic species.

10.1.1

Pauli’s Principle

Two electrons with anti-parallel spins can be separated by inhomogeneous magnetic
fields, even if they are initially in the same place. Therefore, they are distinguishable
3 To guarantee |P Ψ(1,2) |2 = |Ψ(1,2) |2 , we have P Ψ(1,2) = eiφ Ψ(1,2) . From this, P P Ψ(1,2) =
x
x
x x
e2iφ Ψ(1,2) = Ψ(1,2) . Hence, Px Ψ(1,2) = ±Ψ(1,2) .

10.1. SYMMETRIZATION OF BOSONS AND FERMIONS

283

and the wavefunction need not be anti-symmetric. But if we exchange the spin along
with the position, the particles must be indistinguishable. This must be taken into
account in the wavefunction by assigning a spin coordinate, ψa (x1 , s1 ). The exchange
operator should now be generalized,
Px,s Ψ(1,2) ≡ Px,s ψa (x1 , s1 )ψb (x2 , s2 ) = ψa (x2 , s2 )ψb (x1 , s1 ) = Ψ(2,1) .

(10.6)

We now assume that the electrons not only do not interact with each other, but
there is also no interaction between the position and the spin of each electron. That is,
we will discard L·S-coupling 4 . We can then write the total wavefunction of an electron
as the product of a spatial function, ψ(x), and a spin function, χ(s) = α ↑ +β ↓, where
α and β are probability amplitudes of finding the electron in the respective spin state,
such that,
ψ(x, s) = ψ(x)χ(s) .
(10.7)
For two particles, the total spin function is,
X (1,2) = χa (s1 )χb (s2 ) .

(10.8)

The (anti-)symmetrized version is
X S,A =

√1 (X (1,2)

That is, the two electrons may be in a triplet state with the anti-symmetric spatial

This function satisfies

The Slater determinant is zero, when two sets of quantum numbers are identical,
ai = aj . For example, for two electrons in an electronic shell, |ni , li , mi , si i =
|nj , lj , mj , sj i. This is Pauli’s strong exclusion principle:
The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any pair of identical fermions and symmetrical with respect to
exchange any pair of identical bosons.

Pauli’s weak exclusion principle (usually sufficient for qualitative considerations) says
that two fermions in identical states can not occupy the same region in space. That
is, their Broglie waves interfere destructively, as if Pauli’s principle exerted a repulsive
interaction on the particles. This ’force’ has a great impact on the phenomenology of
the bonds between atoms, as we will discuss in the following sections.

10.1.2

Consequences for quantum statistics

The indistinguishability of quantum particles has interesting consequences on the
statistical behavior of bosons and fermions. This becomes obvious when we consider
two particles 1 and 2 being able to adopt two different states a and b. Distinguishable
particles can be in one of the following four states,
Ψ = {ψa (x1 )ψa (x2 ), ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ), ψb (x1 )ψa (x2 ), ψb (x1 )ψb (x2 )}

(10.15)

with the same probability of p = 1/4. Bosonic indistinguishable particles can stay in
one of the following three states,
Ψ = {ψa (x1 )ψa (x2 ), √12 [ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ) + ψb (x1 )ψa (x2 )], ψb (x1 )ψb (x2 )}

(10.16)

with the same probability of p = 1/3. Finally, fermionic indistinguishable particles
can only be in a state,
Ψ = { √12 [ψa (x1 )ψb (x2 ) − ψb (x1 )ψa (x2 )]}

(10.17)

with the same probability of p = 1. We see that a simple two-particle system already
exhibits qualitative modifications of its statistical behavior. These differences generate
different physics as we deal with systems of large numbers of particles, as we can see
in the cases of the free electron gas and the Bose-Einstein condensate.
We finally note a result of the standard model of particle physics assigning a
fermionic character to all fundamental constituent particles of matter while the mediators of fundamental forces are always bosons.

Helium

The simplest atom to discuss Pauli’s principle is helium. The helium atom has a
charged nucleus Z = +2e and mass mHe ≈ 4mH .

10.2.1

The ground state

The ground state of the helium atom brings together the two electrons, that is, (1s)2 .
To treat the helium atom, we can, as a first trial, describe the atom by the Bohr
model, assuming independent electrons. Neglecting the electronic repulsion term
(which depends on r12 ), we can separate the total wavefunction:
Ψ(r1 , r2 ) = Ψ1 (r1 )Ψ2 (r2 ) ,

(10.18)

and we get two Schrödinger equations, the Hamiltonian being equal to the one of
hydrogen-like atoms:

with EB = −13.6 eV. With this, we get the energy for the ground state:
EHe (1s) = −2Z 2 EB = −108.8 eV .

(10.21)

The value predicted by Bohr’s model is far from experimental reality: The ionization energy measured for the first electron is 24.6 eV, for the second 54.4 eV, totalizing

286

CHAPTER 10. ATOMS WITH MANY ELECTRONS

a binding energy for two electrons of −78.983 eV . This corresponds to an error of
about 38%. The lower energy of the first electron is due to the shielding of the nucleus
by the second.
10.2.1.1

First-order perturbation of the energy

Treating the repulsion term between the electrons as a perturbation [24] and using the
eigenfunctions of hydrogen atoms |n, `, m` i, the total wavefunction is |n1 , `1 , m`1 ; n2 , `2 , m`2 i,
we obtain as first order TIPT correction for the energy:
∆E = hn1 , `1 , m`1 ; n2 , `2 , m`2 |

(10.23)

This integral is always positive. The term |Ψn1 ,`1 ,m`1 (r1 )|2 dV1 is the probability of
finding the electron inside the volume element dV1 and, when multiplied by −e, gives
the charge associated with that region. Thus, the integral represents the Coulombian
interaction energy of the confined charges within the two volume elements dV1 and
dV2 . ∆E is the total contribution to the potential energy. Calculating the Coulomb
integral for the ground state, which will be done in Exc. 10.2.3.1, we obtain,

with aB the Bohr radius. ∆E corresponds to 34 eV. Thus, the ground state energy is
EHe (1s) = −108.8 eV + 34 eV = −74.8 eV. Comparing with the experimental value
of −78.983 eV we have an error around 5.3%.
10.2.1.2

Shielding of the nuclear charge

We can make the approximation in which we consider that each electron moves in a
Coulombian potential, with respect to the nucleus, shielded by the charge distribution
of the other electron [166]. The resulting potential will be generated by an effective
charge ζe ≡ (Z − B)e. The quantity B ∈ [0, 1] is called the shielding constant.
The first electron feels a total nuclear charge Ze, while the second feels an effective
nuclear charge ζe. We exchange Z for ζ in the energy term for hydrogen-like atoms,
En = −ζ

EB

(10.25)

and the energy for the ground state becomes, assuming total shielding, B = 1,
E = E1 + E2 = −Z 2 EB − ζ 2 EB = −4EB − EB = −5EB = −67.5 eV .

(10.26)

Comparing with the experimental value of −78, 983 eV we have an error around 15%.
For a shielding constant of around B = 0.656 the experimental value is reproduced.
This means that the effective nuclear charge felt by the second electron is only partly

10.2. HELIUM

287

shielded by the former. The TPIT method (10.22) and the shielding concept (10.25)
can be combined in a variational calculation, where the effective charge ζ is the variational parameter. In Exc. 10.2.3.2 we study the reciprocal shielding of the electrons
at the example of the helium-type ion H− .

10.2.2

Excited states

Let us now investigate the excited states of helium, in particular those, where only one
electron is excited, the other one being in the ground state, (1s)1 (2s)1 and (1s)1 (2p)1 .
All energies are considerably higher (weaker binding) than predicted by Bohr’s model
with Z = 2, because of the interaction with the other electron. Also, the (2s) and
(2p) levels are no longer degenerate, because the electrostatic potential is no longer
Coulombian (see Fig. 10.1).

Figure 10.1: Helium levels for the excitation of the first electron and allowed singlet and
triplet transitions. Note that the state (1s)↑↑ does not exist.

As we have seen in the discussion of the fine structure, the energy of the l · scoupling given by (8.131) is ∝ En (Zα)2 ∝ Z 4 . For helium which still has a small
Z, the energy of the coupling is weak (∼ 10−4 eV), so that we can count on a direct coupling of the spins of the two electrons. Since the orbits of the electrons are
now different, we can construct combinations of symmetric or antisymmetric spatial wavefunctions ΨS,A , are therefore combinations X A,S of anti-parallel or parallel
spins. When the spins are parallel (S = 1), the spatial wavefunction is antisymmetric, when they are antiparallel (S = 0), it is symmetric. From the symmetry of
the wavefunction depends the energy of the coulombian interelectronic interaction,
because in the symmetric state the average distance of the electrons is much smaller
than in the antisymmetric state, where the total spatial function disappears for zero
distance. Consequently, the configuration (1s)1 (2s)1 has two states with S = 0 and
S = 1, with energy ES=0 > ES=1 . Likewise, all configurations are split, as shown in
Fig. 10.1. The energy difference (∼ 1 eV) is considerable and well above the energy
of fine structure interaction. This explains why the two spins first couple to a total

288

CHAPTER 10. ATOMS WITH MANY ELECTRONS

spin, s1 + s2 = S, before this spin couples to the total orbital angular momentum,
S + L = J. This is the L · S-coupling.
10.2.2.1

Exchange energy

The energy difference between the two states S = 0 and S = 1 is called exchange
energy. It comes out of a first-order perturbation calculation. For example, for the
two possible states (1s)1 (2s)1 , we write the total anti-symmetric wavefunctions,

called exchange energy corresponds to the interference terms of the symmetrization
and must be added or subtracted according to their symmetry character. It is interesting to note that up to this point the spin does not enter directly into the helium
Hamiltonian,

but only through the symmetry character of the spatial wavefunction. On the other
hand, on a much smaller energy scale, the spin enters through the L · S-interaction.
The potential is not spherically symmetric, the term r12 depends on the angle
between r1 and r2 . Thus, the total wavefunction Ψ(r1 , r2 ) is not separable into a
radial and an angular part. By consequence, unlike for hydrogen, the Schrödinger
equation with the Hamiltonian (10.21) has no analytical solution.

10.2. HELIUM

289

Example 49 (TIPT for excited helium states): We consider the two electrons of a helium atom occupying different orbits described by wavefunctions
denoted by ψa (1) ≡ ψn1 ,`1 ,m`1 (r1 ) and ψb (2) ≡ ψn2 ,`2 ,m`2 (r2 ). Applying
the Hamiltonian without the interelectronic interaction term, the total states
Θ = ψa (1)ψb (2) and ψa (2)ψb (1) have the same energy Ea + Eb . To calculate the
energy correction, we use TIPT for degenerate states. We have to calculate the
(1)
secular determinant det(hn, ν|H (1) |n, µi − En,µ δµ,ν ). The terms of the matrix

Hence, as J and K are positive, the determinant is:

J −E

yielding,
E (1) = J ± K .
That is, the states that were previously degenerate with energy E = Ea + Eb
are now split into two states with energies E = Ea + Eb + J ± K. And the
corresponding eigenfunctions are:
1
ΨS,A (1, 2) = √ [ψa (1)ψb (2) ± ψb (1)ψa (2)] .
2
This result shows that the repulsion between the two electrons breaks the degeneracy (of separable functions written in product form) into states with an energy
difference 2K. Note that the eigenfunctions are symmetric, which is discussed
in the next section.

10.2.2.2

The spectrum of helium

So far we have seen that, if the electrons are in the same orbital, we have an energy
term E = 2Ea + J and, when they are in different orbitals, we have E = Ea + Eb +
J ± K, with a separation between levels of 2K.
In practice, we consider only the excitation of one electron, because the energy
to excite the two electrons exceeds the ionization energy of the helium atom. To find
the selection rules for transition between symmetric and antisymmetric states, we
calculate the dipole moment of the transition. For a two-electron system the dipole

290

CHAPTER 10. ATOMS WITH MANY ELECTRONS

moment is d̂ = −er1 − er2 , which is symmetric with respect to a permutation of the
two electrons. The matrix element for the dipolar transition is:
Z
A
S
hΨ |d̂|Ψ i = −e Ψ∗A (r1 , r2 )(r1 + r2 )ΨS (r1 , r2 )dV1 dV2 .
(10.32)

If we exchange the electrons, the above integral changes sign, because ΨA (r1 , r2 )
changes sign. But the integral can not depend on the nomenclature of the integration
variables, so it must be zero. The transition between a symmetric and an antisymmetric state can not occur. Looking at the spin wavefunction in Θ = ΨS χA or ΨA χS , we
find that transitions are only allowed between singlet states or between triplet states.
That is, there is a selection rule for the spin postulating ∆S = 0 7,8 .
Because of the differences observed in the singlet and the triplet spectrum of
helium, illustrated in Fig. 10.1, it was first believed that they belong to different
atomic species, called para-helium and ortho-helium. A chemical analysis showed
later that it was the same element.

10.2.3.2

Ex: Shielding in helium

The helium atom (or helium-like atoms such as H − ) has two interacting electrons in its
composition, which means that these systems have no exact solution. To circumvent
this problem we have to come up with a series of approximate methods for calculating
their eigenstates and their respective eigenenergies. Among these methods, a widely
used one, due mainly to its ease and practicality, is the variational method, in which we
calculate the fundamental state of a given problem through a test function that is not
a solution of the original problem. This method, when applied to a helium atom, uses
as test function the solution of the problem without coulombian interaction between
the electrons, which only feel the interaction with the original charge of the nucleus.
However, this method could be further improved if we considered an effective nuclear
charge, due to its interaction with the electrons themselves, and then obtaining the
test function. Apply this correction to the case of helium. Interpret the result. Help:

7 Moreover, transitions between the states 1 S and 3 S are impossible, because they violate the
0

selection rule for the angular momentum, ∆L = ±1.
8 We can understand the selection rules as follows: As long as the wavefunction can be written as
a product, Θ = Ψ(x)χ(s), the symmetry character is preserved for the two functions separately. The
eigenvalues of the operators Px and Ps are then good quantum numbers. But this only holds for
weak L · S-coupling. The electric dipole operator for the transition does not act on the spin (which
prevents the recoupling S = 1 ↔ S = 0 via E1-radiation) and also does not act on the symmetry
character of the orbitals (which prevents transitions ΨS ↔ ΨA ).
In principle, this holds for any species of atoms with two valence electrons. In reality however, the
influence of the L · S-coupling grows with Z, which weakens the interdiction of the intercombination
transition. In this case, only the operator Px,s yields good eigenvalues.

Electronic shell structure

The interelectronic interaction and the need to antissimetrize the wavefunction of
the electrons both contribute to excessively increase the complexity of multielectronic

is extremely complicated to solve, even for the simplest case (Z = 2) we must use
approximation methods.

10.3.1

TIPT method

Note that, if we assume independent electrons (Vele−ele = 0), that is, each electron
moves independently of the others within the electrostatic potential generated by the
nucleus and the other Z − 1 electrons, the problem would be easily solvable: We could
solve the Schrödinger equation for a product state of all the electronic wavefunctions,
and we would know the eigenfunctions and individual eigenenergies of each electron
(as for the hydrogen atom). In principle, we should use antisymmetric wavefunctions,
but as a first approach we can choose to only respect Pauli’s weak principle, that
is, assign an individual and unique set of quantum numbers to each electron. The
total energy would be the sum of the energy of every electron, and the associated
physical eigenstates would be obtained by means of an antisymmetrization of the
tensor product of the multielectronic state.
Thus, as a first approximation, we use the states of individual electrons (orbital
approximation) and consider Vele−ele (|ri − rj |) as a perturbation making use of timeindependent perturbation theory. However, this term is not small enough to justify
this procedure, since approximating
Vncl−ele '

and

Vele−ele '

,
2aB

(10.34)

we realize that Vele−ele /Vncl−ele varies between 41 for Z = 2 and 12 for Z  1/2.
For this reason the use of alternative methods to describe multielectronic atoms is
necessary. Nevertheless, the set of quantum numbers derived from Bohr’s atomic
model are still the same as those used for many-electron atoms, and the orbitals are
used as starting points for more sophisticated methods.
To calculate most of the atomic properties we need reasonably realistic potentials.
The most important terms of the Hamiltonian are the Coulombian potential between
the nucleus and the electrons, Vne , being naturally spherical, and the interaction
potentials between the electrons, Vee , which we will try to approximate by a spherical
potential and treat the deviations caused by the approximation afterward. Knowing
the effect of the shielding of the nucleus by electronic charges, we already know the

10.3.2

Thomas-Fermi model for an electron gas

A first approach to getting a reasonable effective potential Vef f is provided by the
Thomas-Fermi model. This is a semi-classical model that aims to roughly describe the
total energy of the electrons as a density functional of atomic/molecular electrons. It
serves as a basis for more sophisticated methods aiming at determining the electronic
structure, such as density functional theory (DFT), and the wavefunctions determined
by this method often serve as a starting point for the Hartree method discussed below.
One of the important predictions of the Thomas-Fermi model is that the average
radius of an atom depends on the nuclear charge as R̄ ∝ Z −1/3 .
The Thomas-Fermi model allows us to understand the electronic configuration of
the fundamental states and provides the basis for the periodic system of elements. In
this model, the electrons are treated as independent particles, on one side forming an
effective radial electric potential, on the other side being subjected to this potential.
Instead of requiring anti-symmetry of the wavefunction, it is only necessary to ensure
that all electrons are distinguished by at least one quantum number. The orbitals of
complex atoms are similar to the wavefunctions of hydrogen. So, we can use these
quantum numbers n, `, m` , and ms for every electron.
However, the effective radial potential depends very much on the species and is
quite different from the Coulomb potential. So, the degeneracy in ` is lifted. In
general, electrons with small ` are more strongly bound, because they have a higher
probability of being near the nucleus, where the potential is deeper (see Fig. 10.2).
The same argument explains why electrons with small n are more strongly bound.
We will discuss these effects in more depth in Sec. 10.4.1 by comparing the excitation
levels of the valence electron in different alkalis.

Density of states in the Fermi gas model

Even though the real potential sensed by the electrons bound to a nucleus is very
different from the three-dimensional well, we can roughly imagine that the atom is
subdivided into small volumes, understood as box potentials, all filled with electrons.
From this we can calculate the distribution of the electronic charge, such that the
average local energy is homogeneous and the electronic cloud in equilibrium. The
distribution, in turn, serves to determine the shape of the electrostatic potential
which, when subdivided into small volumes filled with electrons, produces the same
charge distribution. This principle is called self-consistency.
According to the Fermi gas model, we consider an infinite potential well, that we
gradually fill up with electrons. The Pauli principle allows us to place at most two
electrons in each orbital,
Ψ = ψ1,↑ (x1 )ψ1,↓ (x2 )ψ2,↑ (x3 )ψ2,↓ (x4 ) · .. .

(10.36)

This total wavefunction satisfies the weak Pauli principle, but is obviously not antisymmetric. The approximation is good, when the interaction between the electrons
is negligible. Otherwise, we need to consider the exchange energy terms. This model,
called Fermi gas model, is often used to describe the behavior of electrons that can
freely move within the conductance band of a metal.
We divide the atom into small volumes (cells) containing N uniformly distributed
non-interacting electrons, whose total number is Nt , and we analyze each cell individually. The whole volume can be modeled by a box potential: V (r) = 0 for
0 ≤ x, y, x ≤ L and V (r) = ∞ in all other places. In this case we find the possible
states {|nx , ny , nz i} with nx , ny , nz = 1, 2, 3 and the single electron energies,

is, below EF all states are occupied and all those above EF are unoccupied. The total
energy is given by the sum of the energies of the N less energetic states, and the final
physical state is given by the antisymmetrization of the corresponding wavefunction.

Thomas-Fermi energy

Fermi’s box potential trick allowed us to model the impact of Pauli’s principle on
the spatial distribution of fermions in a restricted volume, but we did not take into
account yet the fact that electrons are charged and will interact. Hence, the energy
calculated so far is purely kinetic and will have to be complemented by potential
energy.

Electronic density and the Thomas-Fermi equation

Exploiting the variational principle, we are interested in the electronic density ρ(r)
which minimizes the Thomas-Fermi energy. We can perform this process via Lagrange
multipliers under the constraint, that the number of electrons remains constant in the
atom. Thus,

It is important to note the last equation does not depend on the parameter Z,
thus being a general result for any neutral atom. The function χ(x) is determined
numerically, but we can analyze its asymptotic values given the expected behavior
of the effective potential Vef f (r): for r → 0 we expect that Vef f (r) = Vp (r), hence
χ(0) = 1. On the other hand, for r → ∞, we expect Vef f (r) = 0, hence χ(∞) = 0.
With χ(x) known, we obtain the charge density ρ(x), and hence we are able to
calculate the total energy of the atom under investigation. Thus, it is possible to
show that [24],

It is important to highlight some points:
1. The result holds for neutral atoms.
2. There is no electronic shell structure assumed; apart from the fact that the
kinetic energy was derived in a way as to respect Pauli’s principle, the whole
calculation was done within the laws of classical electromagnetism; no quantum
mechanics was involved and, hence, no set of quantum numbers has been found.
3. Apart from the Pauli principle used to calculate the density of states (10.40),
quantum statistical effects of identical particles (such as wavefunction antisymmetrization) are not taken into account.
A more refined model which deals with third criticism and, in addition, is closer to
density functional theory (DFT) is the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac model.

10.3. ELECTRONIC SHELL STRUCTURE

Hartree method

The effective potential obtained from the Thomas-Fermi model can serve as a starting
point for quantum treatment. Assuming that all electrons are subject to the same effective potential Vef f , we numerically solve the Schrödinger equation for each electron
independently,


~2 2
Ĥi = −
∇ + Vef f ψi (ri ) = ei ψi (ri ) .
(10.61)
2m i
With this we calculate all energies and eigenfunctions (only the radial parts are of
interest) minimizing the total energy and respecting the weak Pauli principle, that is,
we classify the states in the order of increasing energies ei and fill them successively
with electrons. For the total wavefunction we obtain,

We replace that potential in the SchrödingerPequation, and repeat the whole process
from the beginning, until the total energy i ei does not get any lower. This selfconsistent method is called Hartree method. Fock improved these calculations using
antisymmetric wavefunctions for the valence electrons. This method is called HartreeFock method.

10.3.4

Hartree-Fock method

The Hartree-Fock method used to treat atomic or molecular many-body systems aims
at obtaining the electronic wavefunction of the system. Dealing with anti-symmetrized
wavefunctions, it represents a refinement of the Hartree method. The method is
based on the variational principle and on the assumption that we can write the global
wavefunction as a Slater determinant, with each electron occupying a specific orbital
state (spin-orbital) and interacting with an effective potential stemming from the
electrons which occupy other orbitals. Instead of solving the Schrödinger equation, we
must now solve a set of equations called Hartree-Fock equations of the type F̂ ψk (1) =
k ψk (1). The method is performed iteratively until convergence of the atomic orbitals
and their respective energies is reached. The procedure is then called self-consistent:
Starting from an initial trial global wavefunction we calculate the effective potential
in each orbital and a new set of wavefunctions which, in turn, generate a new effective
potential. This new potential is then used in a new set of Hartree-Fock equations.

(10.64)

where ĥi is the Hamiltonian only of the electron i, and V̂ij is the interaction term
between the electrons i and j. To implement the method we must suppose that the
multi-electronic state can be written as the product of the individual states of each
electron:
Ψ0 (1, ..., Z) = ψ1 (1)ψ2 (2)...ψZ (Z) ,
(10.65)
where ψi (1) = φi (r1 )χ(α) = ψiα (r1 ) represents the spin-orbital state of electron 1, that
is, the spatial wavefunction of the electron in the state i and with spin α. However, due
to the symmetrization postulate, the physical state of the system must be expressed
by a Slater determinant,
1
Ψ(1, ..., Z) = √ det [ψ1 (1)ψ2 (2)...ψZ (Z)] .
Z!

(10.66)

Now, we use the variational principle to minimize the expectation value of the ground
state energy by varying the functions ψk (n). In this way, the correct orbitals are those
that minimize the energy. The expectation value is written as,

10.4

The periodic system of elements

Completely filled principal layers n, ` are isotropic, ΨN (r) = Ψ(r), as we will show
in Exc. 10.4.4.1. It is important to distinguish three different energetic sequences:
1. Tab. 10.5 shows, for a given atom, the excited orbitals of the last electron. 2. The

300

CHAPTER 10. ATOMS WITH MANY ELECTRONS

energy sequence shown in Tab. 10.6 tells us in which orbital the next electron will be
placed, when we go to the next atom in the periodic table 10.8 which has one more
proton in the nucleus. 3. The inner electrons are subject to different potentials and,
hence, follow a different sequence energetic sequence: While for the inner electrons
we find,
En,` < En,`+1  En+1,` ,
(10.78)
the sequence is partially inverted for the outermost electron. Note that it is the
outermost electrons that determine the chemical reactivity of the atom. The sequence
is illustrated in Fig. 10.4.
Noble gases have small radii, high excitation energies and high ionization energies.
The outermost electrons in a noble gas atom must overcome a large energy the gap to
any higher quantum numbers. Halogens have strong electro-affinities, since the outer
electron layer (nmax ) is incomplete and therefore malleable, such that an electron
approaching the halogen perceives the nucleus through a partially transparent shield.
Alkalis are similar to hydrogen and have excitation energies in the optical regime.
Their fundamental state 2 S1/2 is determined by a valence electron only in the ` = 0
orbital. Unlike hydrogen, excitation energies are highly dependent on `, since orbits
with small ` have higher probabilities to be in the unshielded region −Z 2 e2 /r than
orbits with large `, who spend more time in the shielded region −e2 /r. For the
same reason, energies corresponding to larger n resemble more those of the hydrogen
spectrum.
10.4.0.1

Inner shell electrons

The interior shell structure of the atoms can be analyzed by X-ray scattering. Electrons decelerated by atoms emit a continuous spectrum called bremsstrahlung, but
they can also expel electrons from the inner layers leaving a hole behind. When a
hole is filled by cascades of electrons falling down from higher layers, the atom emits
a specific X-ray spectrum (≈ 104 eV). The selection rules ∆` = ±1 and ∆j = ±1
split the lines in two components. X-ray spectra of neighboring elements in the periodic table are very similar, because the inner layers not being shielded, they see a
potential close to ∝ Z 2 /r. Therefore, the Z-dependency of inner energy levels along
a horizontal rows in the periodic table is more or less ω ∝ Z 2 , as predicted by Bohr’s
atomic model.

10.4.1

Electronic shell model

Each of the energy levels in this sum contains several states. Each of these states
can be occupied by a single electron, according to the Pauli principle. In this way,
we obtain the electronic configuration for the atoms of the periodic system. In this
picture, the energies of the ground states of the elements, normalized by 1/Z 2 , can
be arranged in the scheme 10.3:
This only works for atoms with up to 18 electrons. When the layer 3p is completely
filled, the next to be occupied is not 3d but the 4s. The new scheme is illustrated in
10.4. The anomalies beginning at Z = 18 arise due to electron-electron interaction.
The real potential evolves from one to the other Coulombian potential, as distance

from the nucleus is increased, as illustrated in Fig. 10.2. Near the nucleus, the electrons shield the positive charge less than for large r. Thus, those states that have a
high probability near the nucleus are energetically lowered. That is,
E2s < E2p

and

E6s < E6p < E6d .

(10.79)

The degeneracy of the orbital angular momentum in the Schrödinger model is thus
lifted. The shielding is, as can be seen in the example of the excited states of lithium,
a large effect in the range of some eV.

Figure 10.4: Illustration of the sequence of filling the orbitals with electrons.

The shielding also accounts for the anomalies in the periodic system, such as in
K or Ca. Since E4s < E3d , the 4s state is filled before the 3d. Similar anomalies
also occur in Rb (5s), Cs (6s), and Fr (7s). In rare earths the shielding effect is even
more pronounced. Here, the energy of the state 6s is even below the energy of the
4f , which means that the shells 6s, 5s, 5p, and 5d protect the 4f shell very well 9 .
9 An

example of this is Nd:YAG (Neodymium in Yttrium Aluminum Garnet). In this crystal,

Resolve Exc. 10.4.4.2.
10.4.1.1

Alkalines

The electronic shell structure of alkalines consists of a completed noble gas shell and
an additional valence electron. Their spectrum is therefore very similar to hydrogen.
An empirical approach can be stressed to describe this feature,
En,l = − 21 µEG c2

c2
,
n − ∆(n, l)

(10.80)

where µEG is the reduced mass relative to the noble gas shell and ∆(n, l) is called
quantum defect. The quantum defect is tabulated for most alkaline states and is
particularly important for low energy states. For sodium, for example, the values are:

For states with a large angular momentum, the quantum defect disappears. In
these states, the electron is far from the nucleus and the potential is similar to that of
hydrogen. Alkalines are currently widely studied in quantum optics laboratories, for
being comparatively simple, but having a sufficiently rich structure to be interesting.
The fundamental electronic transitions typically lie in the visible and near-infrared
spectral range and can be excited with comparatively simple laser sources. The
lifetime of excited states is typically longer than 20 ns, which corresponds natural
linewidths of approximately (2π) 10 MHz.
10.4.1.2

Excited states

The experimentally easiest and most precise approach to determining orbital energies
consists in measuring excitation spectra of valence electrons. The table 10.5 compares
such excitation spectra for various alkaline atoms. Although this is not to be confused
with the binding energies of valence electrons of different atoms, it gives us a qualitative idea of the impact of shielding and indicates, which orbital will be occupied by
the additional valence electron of the next species in the periodic table.

10.4.2

LS and jj-coupling

Following Hund’s rule, the L · S-coupling is energetically favorable compared to the
j · j-coupling, which means that the spins of the outermost electrons, that is, the
optical transitions can be excited within the 4f shell of the Nd. However, these transitions are only
allowed due to perturbations of the crystalline field. The very strong shielding ensures a long life of
the excited state. For this reason this crystal is an excellent laser material.

10.4. THE PERIODIC SYSTEM OF ELEMENTS

atoms.

electrons outside of filled subshells (n, `), prefer to orient their spins in parallel in
order to anti-symmetrize the spatial wavefunctions and thus maximize the distance
between the electrons. Every sub-layer of the series shown in Fig. 10.4 must be filled
in the listed order before placing new electrons in the next layer.
In the case of helium, we have seen that the Pauli principle first determines the
relative orientation of the electron spins. The spins si of the individual electrons
therefore add up to a total angular momentum S. The orbital angular momenta li also
adopt a relative orientation. It is determined by a residual spherically non-symmetric
Coulomb interaction: A certain combination L of orbital angular momenta leads to a
certain spatial distribution of the electrons and thus to a certain electrostatic energy
distribution.
The total spin S and the total orbital angular momentum L subsequently couple
to a total angular momentum J very similar to the l-s spin-orbit coupling in single
electron systems. States with different J then have the respective energies that the
total spin S adopts in the field generated by the total orbital angular momentum L 10 .
10 In addition, there are the small contributions due to l · l -coupling and to s · s -coupling, where
i j

i 6= j.

304

CHAPTER 10. ATOMS WITH MANY ELECTRONS

Figure 10.6: Illustration of Hund’s rule.

The above coupling scheme is called Russel-Saunders coupling or LS-coupling.
It works when the spin-orbit coupling is small. In this case, intercombination is
forbidden, which means that there can be no electromagnetic transition between states
with different spins (see metastable helium).
Since ELS ' Zα4 ' Z 4 , for heavy atoms, the coupling of an electronic spin to
its own orbital momentum grows strongly with Z, as well as the symmetrization
and the exchange energy, which mutually orient the spins, and the residual Coulomb
interaction, which mutually couples the angular orbital momenta. In this case, the
orientation of Li relative to Si delivers more energy than the exchange energy and
the residual energy cost. Hence, the spin and the orbital angular momentum of an
individual electron couple first,
ji = li + si .
(10.81)
We obtain a new Hamiltonian of fine structure of the form,
HF S ∝ ji · jj .

(10.82)

Pure jj-coupling only exists for very heavy nuclei. Normally, we have a so-called
intermediate coupling, which is a mixture of LS and jj-coupling. This can considerable relax the intercombination prohibition. When the coupling is pure, we have the
following dipolar selection rules:
LS-coupling: ∆S = 0, ∆L = ±1, ∆` = ±1
jj-coupling: ∆j = 0, ±1 for one e− , ∆j = 0 for all others

10.4. THE PERIODIC SYSTEM OF ELEMENTS

In addition we have for the two couplings: ∆J = 0, ±1, but J, J 0 = 0 is forbidden,
∆mJ = 0, ±1 when ∆J = 0 but mJ , mJ 0 = 0 is forbidden.

10.4.3

Summary of contributions to the atomic energy levels

The total Hamiltonian of a single atom is composed of the kinetic energy of the

the electrons, and of interactions with various types of external electromagnetic fields.

Molecular dimers
In systems of many particles (gases, fluids, or solids) interatomic interactions must
be considered. These interactions usually have electrostatic origins, but generally can
not be given in the form of closed expressions. For example, the collision of two atoms
i and j can occur in a multitude of channels, that is, interaction potentials V (ri − rj ).
Interatomic forces do not only govern collisions, but can sustain molecular bound
states. This introduces new degrees of freedom in the systems of many particles
through possible excitations of vibration or rotation movements.

molecules consisting of two identical or different atoms.

11.1.1

Ionic and covalent binding

There are two fundamental ways of binding two atoms together, the ionic bond and
the covalent bond 1 . The ionic bond is ruled by the quantities electroaffinity (EA),
electronegativity (EN), and ionization energy (IE):
 Ionization energy: This energy is needed for the release of an electron by a
neutral atom, e.g. Na + 5.1 eV → Na+ + e− .
 Electroaffinity: This energy is released by the capture of an electron by a
neutral atom, e.g. Cl + e− → Cl− + 3.8 eV.
 Electronegativity: This quantity measures the stability of a valence orbital,
e.g. that of fluorine (3.98) is more stable than that of cesium (0.79), such that
fluorine holds its electrons tighter than cesium.

At short distances, the exchange of an electron between atoms can decrease energy.
The so-called ionic bond is then sustained by the Coulombian attraction between two
ions, and the binding energy can be estimated through electrostatic interaction.
Example 50 (Ionic binding in NaCl ): For example, a sodium and a chlorine
atom gain energy by forming a molecule,
(11.1)
+

−

Na + 5.1 eV → Na + e

Cl + e− → Cl− + 3.8 eV

Na+ + Cl− → NaCl + 4.9eV

− − − − −− − − − − − − − − − − − −−

Na + Cl → NaCl + (−5.1 + 3.8 + 4.9) eV .

The molecules are polar and, therefore, have a permanent electric dipole moment.
The bond has no preferential direction, since each atom is perfectly isotropic. Therefore, this type is well suited for the construction of crystalline lattices.
1 We

are not considering metallic bonds nor hydrogen bridge bonds, here.

Figure 11.3: Scheme for (a) ionic binding of NaCl and (b) covalent binding of H2 .

To understand covalent bond, we consider the example H+
2 and estimate the interaction energy for each distance R between the nuclei. In this case, in contrast to
atoms, the spherical symmetry is broken, and therefore the energy degeneracy with
respect to parity is abolished, that is, for wavefunctions ψ(−x) = ±ψ(x) the energies
vary differently with R. The even wavefunction, which has an increased probability of
the electron of being between the nuclei, is binding, which means that the interaction
potential exhibits a minimum at a certain distance. The odd wavefunction, which
disappears between the nuclei, is anti-binding, which means that the interaction potential is repulsive at all distances. In fact, an electron located at the center between
two positive charges can overcome the Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei, whose
mutual distance is twice. Obviously, the energy can not fall below that of the fundamental state of He+ , being approximately −4 × 13.6 eV. With two electrons, as
in the case of the neutral molecule H2 , the anti-parallel orientation of the spins, ↑↓,
allows us to place the two electrons in the same orbital, while for parallel orientation,
↑↑, we expect anti-binding. Each electron without a partner in an orbital can form a
covalent bond, for example, phosphorus [P]=[Ne]3s2 3p↑↑↑ has three available orbitals
corresponding to different magnetic quantum numbers. The covalent bond is directional (sp1 , sp2 , or sp3 hybridization), which is essential for the molecular structure
such as in CH4 . Do the Exc. 11.1.6.1.

11.1.2

Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the H+
2 molecule

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecular physics consists in considering,
at first, the positions of the nuclei as being fixed in space. This allows us to study the
stationary states of the electrons subject to the potential created by the nuclei for a
given internuclear distance R. Varying R, the electronic energies (computed for a fixed
R) remain the same, because the electronic wavefunctions adjust instantaneously due
to their mass being much lower than that of the nuclei. The non-varying electronic
energies play the role of interaction potential energies between the nuclei [24].
11.1.2.1

Separation of the center-of-mass

Let us consider two heavy masses, Ma,b = M separated by a distance R and interacting through a potential Vnn (R). Furthermore, there is a light-weighted mass me

Adiabatic approximation

The Born-Oppenheimer approximation now consists in assuming that the movement
of the heavies is independent of the position of me , which allows us to separate the
corresponding wavefunction φ via the ansatz Ψ(R, Re ) = ψ(R, r)φ(R). On the other
hand, the orbital ψ of the light mass me does not change much, when we vary the
distance of the heavies, ∇R ψ(R, r) ' 0. This is only valid, as long as the heavies are
inert on the time scale of the movement of me . Therefore, we can approximate the
second derivative,
∇2R [ψ(R, r)φ(R)] = φ(R)∇2R ψ(R, r) + 2[∇R φ(R)] · [∇R ψ(R, r)] + ψ(R, r)∇2R φ(R)

Treating the interatomic distance R as a fixed parameter, the solution of Eq. (11.6)
provides the electronic orbitals and their energies ε(R). The Born-Oppenheimer potential is composed of the electrostatic repulsive potential of the nuclei and the kinetic
energy of the electron, Vnn (R) + ε(R). In other words, the presence of the electrons
generates an additional interaction energy between the nuclei. By inserting this complete interatomic potential into Eq. (11.7), we can determine its vibrational structure
φvib (R).
Fig. 11.5 shows an example of binary effective nuclear potentials, as a function of
the distance R between the two nuclei. Each curve corresponds to a different solution
of the electronic equation, that is, to a different electronic state. In many cases, such
nuclear potentials have a stable equilibrium region. The bound states located in these
regions are molecular bound states of two atoms.

Figure 11.5: Effective nuclear potentials for the interaction between two rubidium atoms
(Rb2 ).

In practice, the calculation of adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer potentials is difficult
and makes it the subject of sophisticated theories, such as the molecular orbital model
or the valence bond model 2 . We study in Exc. 11.1.6.2 a generalization of the BornOppenheimer approximation.

11.1.3

Linear combination of orbitals and the H2 molecule

In the following we will discuss the electronic structure of the simplest neutral molecule:
H2 . For the low electron states of this molecule, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is totally satisfactory, that is, we want to solve a Schrödinger type equation (11.6),
2 Note that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is no longer good in the presence of relativistic
or spin-orbit coupling effects.

where ’1’ and ’2’ denote the two electrons and ’a’ and ’b’ the nuclei.
This problem can not be solved analytically. The standard procedure begins with
choosing a suitable basis, i.e. a very compact basis which does not depend on the
configuration of the molecule. That is, we want the basis to be composed of functions
that do not depend on the distance between the two nuclei, Rab , to avoid calculations
for different bond lengths.
The most natural basis functions are the available atomic orbitals of the individual
hydrogen atoms. When the bond length is too large, the system approaches the limit
of two non-interacting hydrogen atoms. In this case, the electron wavefunction can
be approximated by the product of atomic orbitals (AO) of atom ’a’ and atom ’b’.
Therefore, the smallest basis that gives us a realistic picture of the fundamental state
of the H2 molecule must comprise two functions: |1sa i and |1sb i. For finite bond
lengths, it is advisable to allow the AOs to polarize and deform in response to the
presence of the other electron (and the other nucleus). However, the |1sa i and |1sb i
functions do not have to be exactly the hydrogenic eigenfunctions. It is sufficient
to require them to be similar to the 1s orbitals and be centered on them. Since the
actual shape of the orbitals is not yet fixed, we will give all the expressions in abstract
matrix form, leaving the spatial integration for once the shape of the orbitals has been
specified. This is the method of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

11.1.4

Molecular orbital theory

We are now in a position to discuss the basic principles of the molecular orbital method
(MO), which is the basis of the theory of the electronic structure of real molecules.
The first step in any MO approach is to separate the Hamiltonian into two parts,
one part describing the electrons ’1’ and ’2’ separately and one part counting for the
interaction between them:

± =  ± hab

and

|φ± i ∝ 12 (|1sa i ± |1sb i) .

(11.11)

11.1. MOLECULAR BINDING

The one-electron effective Hamiltonian eigenstates are called molecular orbital (MO).
They are one-electron wavefunctions delocalized over the spatial regions of the molecule.

Figure 11.6: Illustration of the atomic orbitals.

We need to first normalize the MOs, which is more complicated than it might
seem, because the AOs are not orthogonal. For example, when the atoms approach
each other, their AOs may have the shape shown in Fig. 11.6. However, by defining
the overlap integral by S ≡ h1sa |1sb i, we can normalize as follows:
|φ± i = √

1
(|1sa i
2(1±S)

± |1sb i) ,

(11.12)

± h1sa |1sb i ± h1sb |1sa i + h1sb |1sb i) = 1 .

(11.13)

since,
hφ± |φ± i =

1
2(1±S) (h1sa |1sa i

These eigenfunctions merely show the symmetry of the molecule. The two hydrogen
atoms are equivalent and, therefore, the eigenorbital must give equal weight to each
1s orbital. Thus, our choice of the one-electron Hamiltonian does not really matter that much, because every one-electron Hamiltonian exhibiting the symmetry of
the molecule would give the same molecular orbitals. For historical reasons, |φ+ i is
denoted by |σi and |φ− i by |σ ∗ i.
The second step in MO theory consists of constructing the determinant from the
MOs corresponding to the wanted states. For illustration we will look at the lowest
singlet state constructed from molecular orbitals. We note that hab < 0, such that
|σi has an energy inferior to |σ ∗ i. Neglecting the interaction, the lowest singlet state,
|ΦM O i = |σi|σ ∗ i ,

(11.14)

is the molecular ground state of H2 . To estimate the validity of the approximation,
we calculate the expectation value of the energy, hσ|hσ ∗ |Ĥ|σi|σ ∗ i , decomposing the
wavefunction into spin and spatial parts, noting that the spin part is normalized:
hσ|hσ ∗ |Ĥ|σi|σ ∗ i = hσ(1)|hσ(2)|Ĥ|σ(1)i|σ(2)ihΦspin |Φspin i

(11.15)

= hσ(1)|hσ(2)|Ĥ|σ(1)i|σ(2)i .
Hence, with (11.10) we get,
hσ(1)|hσ(2)|ĥ(2)|σ(1)i|σ(2)i = hσ(1)|σ(1)ihσ(2)|h(2)|σ(2)i = hσ(2)|h(2)|σ(2)i ≡ σ

hσ(1)|hσ(2)|ĥ(1)|σ(1)i|σ(2)i = hσ(1)|h(1)|σ(1)ihσ(2)|σ(2)i = hσ(1)|h(1)|σ(1)i ≡ σ

Each of the first two terms represents the energy of a single electron (either 1 or 2)
in the field produced by both the nuclei (ĥ), while the third is the average repulsion
between the two electrons. Note that the first and second term are both positive,
such that the bond must come from the one-electron part. This is the MO energy
for the ground state of the H2 . We can try a more reasonable ansatz for the 1stype basis functions 3 by determining the unknown quantities from above (σ and
Jσσ ) numerically and plot the total energy as a function of Rab (blue dotted curve
in Fig. 11.7). The exact adiabatic energy function determined from experimental
data (solid black curve) agrees well at low energies. Summarizing the results with
some key numbers, we note that MO theory predicts a bond distance of 0.072 nm
in reasonable agreement with the exact value of 0.074 nm. We can also compare the
binding energies,
De = EH2 (Requil ) − 2EH .
(11.18)
MOs theory predicts a binding energy of 5.0 eV compared to the experimental value
of 4.75 eV. In view of the simplicity of the wavefunction and the absence of adjustable
parameters the agreement is not so bad. Unfortunately, far away from the equilibrium
distance, we have an unpleasant surprise: the molecule does not dissociate into two
hydrogen atoms!
3 It turns out that it is more convenient to adjust the exponential decomposition of the hydrogenic
orbitals to a sum of Gaussians.

valence electron in the atomic 1s orbital: When the atoms approach, the atomic orbitals
form new molecular binding and anti-biding orbitals.

To get an idea of what is happening near dissociation, we expand the fundamental
MO state in terms of AO configurations:
|ΦM O i ∝ |σ(1)i|σ(2)i|Φspin i

(11.19)
+ |1sb (1)i|1sb (2)i)|Φspin i .

The two terms in the middle of the last line, called covalent configurations, are exactly
what we expect near dissociation: one electron in each hydrogen atom. However, the
first and last term (which are called ionic configurations) correspond to having two
electrons in one atom and none in the other, which gives us H + and H − at dissociation! Since the weight of these terms is fixed, it is obvious that we got the wrong
wavefunction (and therefore the wrong energy) when dissociating the molecule. Near
the equilibrium point, the ionic terms contribute significantly to the true wavefunction, such that the MO theory is good at this point. But it is always terrible at
dissociation.

11.1.5

Valence binding

An alternative to MO theory represents the valence bond theory (VB). Here, we use
significantly more physical intuition and discard the ionic configurations from the MO
wavefunction. Thus, the VB ground state wavefunction is:
|1sa (1)i|1sa (2)i + |1sb (1)i|1sa (2)i | ↑ (1)i| ↓ (2)i + | ↓ (1)i| ↑ (2)i

VB theory assumes that this wavefunction is a good approximation to the true wavefunction at all binding distances and not only at large distances Rab . To verify this
approximation, we can calculate the average energy for this VB state. First, we
normalize the VB wavefunction,

Therefore, the correctly normalized VB wavefunction is:

|ΨV B i = √

(11.22)
Now we want to calculate hĤel i for this state. We note that the spin part does not
matter, since the Hamiltonian is independent of spin:
hΨV B |Ĥ|ΨV B i = hΨspin |hΨspace |Ĥ|Ψspace i|Ψspin i

(11.23)

= hΨspace |Ĥ|Ψspace ihΨspin |Ψspin i = hΨspace |Ĥ|Ψspace i .

The only remnant of the spin state is the fact that the spatial wavefunction is symmetric, which is only possible when the spin part is antisymmetric. Treating each
term in hĤi separately,

The second and third terms are the same. They are called exchange integrals, because
the ’bra’ orbitals have switched order as compared to the ’kets’:
K = h1sa (1)|1sb (2)|V̂12 |1sb (1)i|1sa (2)i = h1sb (1)|1sa (2)|V̂12 |1sa (1)i|1sb (2)i .
(11.27)
The first and forth terms are also the same. They are called Coulomb integrals,
because they seem to be due to the Coulomb interaction between two charge densities:
J = h1sb (1)|1sa (2)|V̂12 |1sa (1)i|1sb (2)i = h1sa (1)|1sb (2)|V̂12 |1sb (1)i|1sa (2)i . (11.28)

The Coulomb and exchange terms are positive. Nuclear repulsion is clearly positive.
Thus, the only terms that lead to binding in this picture are the average energy of
an electron  and the resonance integral hab . If the first term is dominant, the bond
is due to electronic delocalization, since an electron located near one of the atoms
would only contribute the atomic value to , which does not imply a bound state. If
hab is large, the bond involves some resonance character, which can be related to the
familiar concept of resonance between different Lewis point structures.
A numerical evaluation of all integrals gives the potential curve presented in
Fig. 11.7 for VB theory. As expected, this simple VB wavefunction gives the correct dissociation threshold, where MO theory fails. In addition, the accuracy of the
simple VB result is surprisingly good even near the equilibrium distance: The VB
predicts a bond distance of 0.071 nm (compared to the correct value of 0.074 nm)
and De = 5.2 eV (compared to 4.75 eV). Thus, the VB wavefunction also gives a
good agreement without adjustable parameters. But more importantly, it indicates a
way of improving the wavefunction whenever we encounter an obvious error: in this
case, we saw that the description of the dissociation was weak, and we constructed a
VB ansatz curing the problem. This approach to VB is often generalized as follows
when dealing with polyatomic molecules. We write the wavefunction as a product of
a spatial part and a spin:
|Ψi = |Ψspace i|Ψspin i .
(11.31)
The main assumption in VB theory is that the spatial part can be well represented
by a product of atomic-like functions. For example, for water, we would immediately
write a spatial part as:
|Ψspace i ' |1sHa i|1sHb i|1sO i|1sO i|2sO i|2sO i|2pxO i|2pxO i|2pyO i|2pyO i .

(11.32)

However, there are two things wrong with this wavefunction. First, we know that
atomic orbitals hybridize in a molecule. Therefore, we need to make appropriate

320

CHAPTER 11. MOLECULAR DIMERS

linear combinations of AOs (in this case sp3 hybrids) to obtain the hybridized AOs.
In this case, the four sp3 hybrids can be written symbolically as:
|sp3 i = cs,i |2si + cx,i |2px i + cy,i |2py i + cz,i |2pz i .

(11.33)

and therefore, a more appropriate spatial configuration is:
|Ψspace i ' |1sHa i|1sHb i|1sO i|1sO i|sp31O i|sp31O i|sp32O i|sp32O i|sp33O i|sp34O i .

(11.34)

The other problem with this state is that it lacks the adequate symmetry to describe
fermions; the general state must be antisymmetric. In the case of two electrons this
concept is easy to apply - singlets have symmetric space parts and triplets antisymmetric ones. However, in the case of many electrons, the rules are not so simple;
in fact, the time of numerical computation grows exponentially with the number of
electrons.
Formally, we will leave the derivation at this point to defining an operator A which
’antisymmetrizes’ the wavefunction. In this case,


|Ψspace i ' A |1sHa i|1sHb i|1sO i|1sO i|sp31O i|sp31O i|sp32O i|sp32O i|sp33O i|sp34O i .
(11.35)
In general, the results of VB theory are very accurate for small systems, where it can
be applied. The predicted bond lengths are rather short, and the binding energies
tend to be too small, but the results are nevertheless qualitatively excellent. In addition, the correct hybridized atomic orbitals fall directly off the calculation, giving a
good qualitative insight. Also, note that the atomic configurations should not change
(or very little) when the geometry of the molecule changes (since the orbitals depend
on the atom and not on the molecular structure). Therefore, these VB wavefunctions
have a strong connection to the diabatic states discussed above. However, the exponential amount of time that one must invest to perform these calculations makes
them impractical for most molecules of interest.

Rovibrational structure of molecular potencials

The separation of the motion of the nuclei from the electronic dynamics made in the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation led to equations (11.6) and (11.7). In a preceding
section we analyzed in detail the equation (11.6) with the objective of understanding
the phenomenon of molecular binding.
In the following section we will analyze the equation (11.7), which determines the
motion of the nuclei. By separating the radii and angular parts of the motion, we will
discover vibrational and rotational states.

with

Vmol (R) =

(11.36)

The interaction potential Vmol is composed of a repulsive internuclear Coulomb force
and a Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic potential due to the interaction of the electrons
with each other and with the two nuclei 4 . The kinetic energy is that of the relative
motion (the center-of-mass motion has already been separated in Sec. 11.1.2, such that
this inertial system is free of translational kinetic energy). In spherical coordinates,

where uv (R) = rRv (R) is the radial wavefunction of nuclear motion. The interatomic
potential causes a motion of vibration. The vibrational states of the adiabatic potential are quantized and characterized by a well-defined vibrational energy. We will
discuss the ro-vibrational structure in the following sections.
11.2.1.1

Rotational and vibrational bands

Molecules have much more degrees of freedom than atoms. For example, the atoms of
a molecular dimer may vibrate inside the mutual interaction potential. In the centerof-mass system we can imagine these vibrations as oscillations of an atom with reduced
mass and quantized energy. The molecule can rotate and have a momentum of inertia.
These degrees of freedom contribute energies to the molecule’s Hamiltonian, either
directly or through interactions with other degrees of freedom. Therefore, molecular
spectra are characterized by a much greater complexity.
However, the energy regimes of the strongest excitations are quite different. A
typical range for binding energies (depth of the interatomic potential) is ∆Ep '
4 We note here that at great distances other forces called van der Waals forces dominate the
interatomic interaction. These will be discussed in Sec. 11.3.

(1..10 eV). The spacing between vibrational excitations typically is Ev+1 −Ev ' THz
(0.01 eV). Finally, the rotational excitations are on the scale of E`+1 − E` ' 100 MHz
(10−6 eV). Since at room temperature (a gas of molecules in thermal equilibrium
at T = 300 K) the energy is on a scale of 2.5 × 10−2 eV, the degree of freedom of
the electronic excitation is frozen, while a wide distribution of vibrational and rotational states can be excited (e.g. by intermolecular collisions). The large difference of
scales facilitates their separation and, therefore, the identification of the origin of the
observed states in experimental measurements.

11.2.2

Vibrational molecular states

The potential energy of a molecule grows when the nuclei are displaced from their
equilibrium positions. When the displacement, x ≡ R − Re is small, we can expand

11.2.2.1

Anharmonic vibrations in the Morse potential

For larger displacements we can no longer despise the anharmonic terms in the Taylor
expansion. A better approximation is the Morse potential. This potential (blue in
Fig. 11.10), unlike the harmonic potential (red in Fig. 11.10), is characterized by an
asymptote for large interatomic distances. Therefore, it is often used as an analytical
approximation to molecular potentials,
Vmorse = De (1 − e−a(R−Re ) )2 ,

(11.44)

where r is the interatomic distance, re the equilibrium bond distance, De the depth
of the potential measuring from the dissociation limit, and a a parameter controlling
the range of the potential. At the bottom of the potential we can make the harmonic
approximation, Vmorse (R) ' k2 (R − Re )2 with k = 2a2 De . Rewriting the potential in
the form,
Ṽ (R) ≡ V (R) − De = De (e−2a(R−Re ) − 2e−a(R−Re ) ) ,
(11.45)
we see, that it is a combination of a short-range repulsive potential and long-range
attractive potential (similar to the Lennard-Jones’s potential).
The calculation of the energy spectrum of this potential is more difficult [144],

Ev = ~ω(v + 1/2) − ~ωχe (v + 1/2)2 − De ,

with ωχe ≡ 2M
and ω ≡ k/Mr , but the availability of an analytical expression

is interesting for the calibration of numerical methods. The second term of the expression (11.46), which is proportional to the anharmonicity constant χe , becomes
dominant at high excitations. The potential is finite with a dissociation energy of,
D0 = De − E0 .

(11.47)

5 Electronically excited states (that is, one of the valence electrons moves to an excited orbital)
are more weakly bound, because the electrons are not in the most binding orbital.

11.2.2.2

CHAPTER 11. MOLECULAR DIMERS
Vibrational selection rules

Electromagnetic fields of the type E1, e.g., black body radiation, can induce transitions between vibrational states and redistribute their populations such as to establish
a thermal equilibrium. However, as the stronger transitions are induced by dipole migrations of charges, we need to analyze in more detail the selection rules imposed on
the dipole moment hf |d|ii.
The states which are relevant for vibrational transitions are specified by |, vi,
where  denotes the electronic state of the molecule, since the vibrational spectrum
depends on the electronic structure. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows
us to consider the slow vibrations separately from the dynamics of the electrons.
The time scale for electronic transitions is 1/∆Ee = 10−16 s−1 , and for a nuclear
vibration it is 1/∆Ev = 10−13 s−1 . For each internuclear distance the electrons
form an adapted stationary state, minimizing their energy for that distance. This is
equivalent to the formation of an adiabatic interaction potential between the nuclei on
which the nuclei can vibrate. To find out which vibrational transitions are possible,
we need to calculate the matrix,
h0 , v 0 |d̂|, vi = hv 0 |d̂ |vi .

(11.49)

The dipole moment, d = h|d̂|i, of the molecule depends on the distance of the
nuclei, since the electronic orbitals |i depend on distance. Therefore, we can expand,
d̂ = d̂0 +

dd̂0
1 d2 d̂0 2
x̂ +
x̂ + .. .
dx
2 dx2

(11.50)

Therefore, the transition matrix is,

dd̂0 0
d2 d̂0 0 2
hv |x̂|vi +
hv |x̂ |vi + .. .
dx
dx2

(11.51)

The first term disappears, that is, transitions can only occur, when the dipole moment
varies with the distance. Therefore, homonuclear dimers do not undergo vibrational
transitions.
For heteronuclear molecules with electronic charges that do not depend on the
interatomic distance, the dipole moment varies linearly with small displacements. In
this case, we only need the second term of the expansion. Within the harmonic
approximation, the position operator can be expressed by, x̂ ∝ â + â† . Therefore,
only transitions ∆v = ±1 are possible. However, due to anharmonicities, higher
order terms, x̂n ∝ (â + â† )n become influential, and transitions with ∆v = ±2, ±3, ..
become possible.
Thus, in anharmonic potentials, the vibrational selection rules are replaced by the
concept the overlapping wavefunctions called Franck-Condon factor.
Raman spectroscopy is a very useful tool to analyze ro-vibrational spectra. In this
method, inelastic Raman scattering gives rise to Stokes and anti-Stokes lines in the
spectrum at frequencies corresponding to ∆v = ±1, ±2. The ground state spectrum
is asymmetric, because of the absence of the lower state. In homonuclear dimers, the
nuclear spins have a major impact on the Raman spectra. Parity considerations show
that there can only be odd or even lines.

The Franck-Condon principle

The intensity of molecular transitions are, qualitatively, described by the FranckCondon principle, whose classical formulation goes as follows:
The jump of an electron in a molecular transition occurs during a very
small time compared to the time scale of the nuclear motion, so that immediately after the jump, the nuclei remain practically at the same positions
and at the same velocities as before the jump [295].
For this reason, the transitions are drawn vertically in the scheme of potentials shown
in Fig. 11.11(right). To yield considerable rates, transitions must occur when the
nuclear velocities in the two coupled states are similar, which is the case at the
classical turning points. At these points, the wavefunctions are maximal 6 .

Figure 11.11: (Left, code) Molecular wavefunctions in a potential for three different

vibrational states. (Right) Pictorial representation of the classical statement of the
Franck-Condon principle. Transition (a) has high intensity (or probability), because
here both, the position and the relative velocity of the nuclei do not change. Transitions (b) and (c) are unlikely, because they necessitate either a change in the position
of the nuclei (case b) or in velocity (case c).
With this Franck-Condon principle, we can determine which are the strongest
transitions between vibrational levels of a molecule, as represented in Fig. 11.11(left).
In particular, we are interested in transitions between vibrational levels of different
electronic states.
The exact transition probabilities are calculated via the square module of the
transition dipole moment (TDM). The TDM is an out-of-diagonal matrix element of
the electric dipole operator M, given by:
MAB = hΨ(A) |M̂|Ψ(B) i ,
being |Ψ(A) i and |Ψ(B) i two molecular states.
6 Note

that the presence of a hyperfine structure can modify the selection rules.

(11.52)

328

CHAPTER 11. MOLECULAR DIMERS

Still within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we can split the dipole moment
operator into two terms, a nuclear and an electronic term, according to:
M̂(r, R) = M̂e (r, R) + M̂n (R) .

(11.53)

Thus, the TDM is:
Z
MAB = Ψ(A)∗ M̂Ψ(B) dRdr
(11.54)
Z
Z
Z
= M̂e ψe(A)∗ ψe(B) ψn(A)∗ ψn(B) dRdr + M̂n ψn(A)∗ ψn(B) ψe(A)∗ ψe(B) drdR .
Since the electronic wavefunctions of different states are orthogonal, it follows that
R (A)∗ (B)
ψe ψe dr = 0, canceling the second term.
Looking at the first term, we note that the electronic dipole moment M̂e (r, R)
also depends on the nuclear coordinates as a parameter. The quantum formulation
of the Franck-Condon principle consists in stating that, in a molecular state, the
electronic dipole moment varies little with the nuclear coordinates. Thus, along with
the condition of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we can split the first TDM
term into electronic and nuclear integrals:
Z
Z
MAB = M̂e ψe(A)∗ ψe(B) dr
ψn(A)∗ ψn(B) dR .
(11.55)
Thus, we have a comparative expression for the transition probability given by:
PAB ∝ |MAB |2 =

(11.56)

The second factor in equation (11.56) is called Franck-Condon factor. When we
study the transitions between two electronic states, this factor compares the intensities
of the transitions between distinct pairs of vibrational levels.
Example 52 (Ultracold molecules): Ultracold molecules have been proposed
for a variety of applications, such as ultra high resolution spectroscopy [416],
test of fundamental laws of physics [164, 554], quantum computation [163] and
others[107]. Most of these applications, however, require that the molecular
sample be in a single quantum state. This is an experimental challenge, since
molecules have more degrees of freedom than atoms, such as rotation and vibration.
To create a sample of molecules trapped in the ground state of vibration, a
possible method is to first produce the molecules from ultracold atoms using a
process called photo association, and then pump these molecules to the vibrational ground state.
Photoassociation consists in the excitation of a pair of free atoms to the bound
state of an excited electronic potential by the absorption of a photon. The pair
then decays by spontaneous emission either back to the state of two free atoms
(which is not desirable), or to a bound state of the fundamental electronic potential. For Rb2 molecules, photoassociation is efficient at certain frequencies

11.2. ROVIBRATIONAL STRUCTURE OF MOLECULAR POTENCIALS

329

[421], with the A1 Σ+
u potential as the excited state (see Fig. 11.12).
Soon after being formed, the molecules are usually in levels of high vibrational
energy (around ν ≈ 80), because these levels connect best (high Franck-Condon
overlap) to the excited state. The transfer of population to the fundamental
state of vibration is done by ’optical pumping’.
Vibrational cooling via optical pumping can be done by irradiating a broad frequency band of light that excites transitions to vibrational levels of the excited
nuclear potential. These excited states are chosen such that their Franck-Condon
overlap with the ground states of lower vibrational energy is larger. As a consequence, a molecule sent to an excited state returns with higher probability
to a level of lower vibrational energy. The absorption and emission cycles are
repeated, until the molecules reach the fundamental vibrational state.

Since at ambient temperatures many rotational levels are populated, we experimentally observe many lines known as P -branch, when ∆` = −1, as Q-branch, when
∆` = 0, and as R-branch, when ∆` = 1. See Exc. 11.2.6.3.

Rotational selection rules

For transitions between electronic states, the selection rules are ∆r = 0, ±1. Rotational transitions can occur between levels ∆r = ±1. ∆r = 0 is not allowed, because
it violates the conservation of parity. Note also that the nuclear isotope influences
the ro-vibrational levels via the reduced mass.
We consider a linear molecule in the state |, `, M` i, where  denotes the electronic
and vibrational state of the molecule. To find out which transitions are possible, we
need to calculate the matrix,
h0 , `0 , M`0 |d|, `, M` i = h`0 , M`0 |d |`, M` i ,

(11.64)

with d = h|d|i. Here, we apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which
allows us to separate the dynamics of the electrons and also the vibrations of the
molecule, because these movements are so fast, that they are always in a steady state,
adiabatically following the slow movement of the rotation.
The selection rules can now be derived from the Wigner-Eckart theorem,

Localization energy

One consequence of Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation is that a certain localization
energy is always required to localize a particle. As an example, we consider the
attractive potential,

is, at least half of the wavelength must fit within the potential (between 0 and rt ) at
the height of the bound state. Therefore,
|E|1−2/α >

11.2.5.4

Bound states

For bound states, we must simultaneously satisfy the eigenvalue problem. We can,
for example, guess an eigenvalue E, calculate the associated wavefunction f (R),
check whether it diverges for R → ∞, and vary E until f (R) no longer diverges.
Fig. 11.14(b) shows the wavefunction of a vibrational state obtained by solving the
Schrödinger equation and adjusting the energy until the function stops diverging in
the classically forbidden range.
11.2.5.5

The Fourier grid method

Another, extremely rapid, numerical method for determining the spectrum of vibrational states of a potential, is the Fourier grid method. It is based on the discretization
of the Hamiltonian along the interatomic potential. We write the Hamiltonian as,
Hψ(R) = [T (R) + V (R)]ψ(R) = Eψ(R) ,

and put it in a matrix form using the set of functions of the basis φi (Rj ) = δ(Ri − Rj )
with i = 1, .., N , where Ri = R0 +i(RN −R0 )/N . This problem has N eigenvalues Ei .
The Fourier grid method now evaluates the kinetic energy at each point in the grid.
We insert the local terms Hii = H(Ri ) and the non-local terms Hij = H(Ri , Rj ) into
the Hamiltonian, as well as the potential energies Vij = V (Ri )δij . The kinetic energy
is the inverse Fourier transform from momentum space of Trs = T (kr )δrs = (kr2 /2µ)δrs

Van der Waals forces and spin coupling

The individual atoms have a complex substructure due to the angular momenta of the
electronic motion, its spins and the nuclear spin. All of these angular momenta can
interact, couple and generate new energy terms, which need to be taken into account
when calculating the various potentials of interatomic interaction,

The Coulomb interaction for interacting alkaline gases can be expressed as:

Vcoulomb (R) = Vcoulomb
PS=0 + Vcoulomb

(11.82)

The projectors PS=0,1 will be required to expand the Hilbert space for the degrees of
freedom of the spins.
The van der Waals forces include all intermolecular forces. These are long-range
forces that occur between permanent and induced atomic dipoles ∼ 1/r6 9
9 They also occur, in a pure form, in optical resonators such as in the Casimir effect. Since the
√
lowest frequency in a cavity is ω = 2πc/L, the zero point energies inside and outside the cavity are
different. This causes an attractive force between the cavity mirrors ∼ 1/r3 , 1/r4 .

(11.83)
Vmorse = Dm 1 − e−Bm (R−Rm ) − 1 .
Here, Bm is the width of the minimum, Rm the position of the minimum, Dm the

(11.84)

De is the energy of dissociation. The van der Waals coefficients Ck , which determine
the potential shape at large distances, can be calculated using other methods with
higher precision. To obtain a closed formula, the short and long range parts can be
joined by,
V = Vmorse F + Vvdw (1 − F ) ,
(11.85)
10

where F ≡ e−(R/Rt ) .
The situation is different for collisions of identical atoms in excited states, which
has a much larger range because of the resonant interaction between dipoles. In this
case, an additional Movre-Pichler potential dominated by a coefficient C3 arises,

In contrast, excited state collisions of different species are purely short ranged.

Obviously, the atomic angular momentum is no longer a conserved quantity, but
its projection onto the interatomic molecular axis is. The various possibilities how L,
S, and j are projected onto the internuclear axis or directly couple to the rotational
angular momentum ` are handled by Hund’s cases (a) to (e). The spin coupling is
described by {9j}-symbols, as discussed below.

11.3.3

Hund’s coupling cases

The coupling force between atomic spins depends on the distance between the atoms.
Due to the variety of spins appearing in atoms, there are many possibilities how they
can couple. These were classified by Hund into five cases.
11.3.3.1

Hund’s case (a)

The molecular interaction is so strong that L and S couple to the z-axis instead of
coupling to each other. This case is analogous to the Paschen-Back effect,
L→Λ

and

the singlet and triplet series starting from the lowest energy levels. An alternative
notation is to assign labels ordered by energy X = (1), (2), ... Finally, ± is the
symmetry upon reflection. For example, X 1 Σ+

Collisions
Until now, we mostly restricted our studies to individual atoms or molecules. In
practice, however, we investigate atomic or molecular gases by spectroscopic methods.
The constituents of thermal gases are constantly in motion. They are subject to
Doppler-shifts of their spectral lines and they collide with each other. Colliding
atoms often get so close, that the electronic orbitals affect each other, which leads to
distortions of the interaction potentials, spectral lineshifts and modifications of the
interatomic forces. These are the topics to be addressed in the present chapter.

Figure 12.1: Atoms may interact via exchange of (a) virtual photons or (b) real photons.

12.1

Motion of interacting neutral atoms

The following sections, devoted to the relative motion of two neutral atoms, are
adapted from J. Walraven’s excellent lectures on Quantum Gases available at [638].
The atoms are presumed to move slowly, typically at large separation, and to interact
pair wise through a potential of the Van der Waals type. The term slowly refers to,
s
2π
2π~2
ktherm r0  1
where
λtherm =

(12.1)
ktherm
mkB T
is the thermal de Broglie wavelength and r0 the range of the interaction potential.
As the Van der Waals interaction gives rise to elastic collisions, the total energy
of the relative motion is conserved in time. As the potential energy vanishes at
large interatomic separation the total energy is usually expressed in the form E =
~2 k 2 /2mr . This implies that also the wavenumbers for the relative motion before
and after the collision must be the same and shows that, far from the potential
center, the collision can only affect the phase of the wavefunction - not its wavelength.
Apparently, the appearance of a shift in phase relative to the free atomic motion
341

342

CHAPTER 12. COLLISIONS

provides the key to the quantum mechanical description of elastic collisions. This
being said, we postpone the discussion of the actual collisional behavior to Sec. 12.2.
First we prepare ourselves for this discussion by analyzing the stationary states for
the motion in the presence of an interaction potential.
An important simplifying factor in the description of ultracold collisions is the
emergence of universal behavior in the relative motion of the atoms. The latter
applies to low-energy collisional states as well as to weakly bound states. Universal
means in this context that, asymptotically (for r  r0 ), the wavefunctions become
independent of the details of the interaction potential but can be characterized in
terms of a few parameters, each representing some characteristic length scale of the
collisional system. In other words, very different short-range physics can give rise to
the same scattering behavior. From a theory point of view this universality has the
enormous advantage that the essential features of ultracold collisions can be described
with the aid of simple model potentials for which analytical solutions can be obtained.
In our analysis of the collisional motion three characteristic length scales will
appear, the interaction range r0 the scattering length a and the effective range re , each
expressing a different aspect of the interaction. The range r0 is the distance beyond
which the interaction may be neglected even for k → 0. The second characteristic
length, the s-wave scattering length a, acts as an effective hard-sphere diameter. It
is a measure for the interaction strength and determines the collision cross section in
the limit k → 0 as will be elaborated on in Sec. 12.2. The third characteristic length,
the effective range re expresses how the potential affects the energy dependence of
the cross section and determines when the k → 0 limit is reached.
The s-wave scattering length is the central parameter for the theoretical description of bosonic quantum gases. It determines both the thermodynamic and the collisional properties of these gases. In single-component fermionic gases the s-wave
scattering length plays no role because the wavefunction for the relative motion of
the atoms has to be antisymmetric. In two-component fermionic gases this restriction
is absent for collisions between atoms of different components. As a consequence, in
these systems the inter-component s-wave scattering length determines the collision
related properties - for instance the thermalization rate.
In Sec. 12.1.1 we show how the phase shift appears as a result of interatomic
interaction in the wavefunction for the relative motion of two atoms. For free particles
the phase shift is zero. An integral expression for the phase shift is derived. In
Sec. 12.1.2 and beyond we specialize to the case of low-energy collisions (kr0  1).
The basic phenomenology is introduced and analyzed for simple model potentials like
the hard-sphere (Sec. 12.1.2) and the spherical well (Sec. 12.1.3), where the existence
of a short range is manifest. For the discussion of arbitrarily shaped potentials, we
refer to the script [638].

Low-energy limit: the s-wave regime

This is illustrated in Fig. 12.2. In the classically inaccessible region of space (r < rtp )

p

kr0 = `(` + 1)

(12.9)

which implies that, for ` 6= 0, the classical turning point is found at a distance much
larger than the range r0 of the interaction. As the range r0 defines the distance beyond
which the potential can be neglected, this inequality shows that the radial motion is
not affected by the presence of the potential V (r) in the radial wave equation. The
notable exception is the case ` = 0, where the barrier is absent and the potential gives
rise to a substantial distortion of the radial waves. In other words, for kr0  1 phase
shifts (i.e. scattering) can only arise from collisions with zero angular momentum.
The range of collision energies where the inequalities (12.9) are valid is called the
s-wave regime.

Here, the derivatives are with respect to the new variable.
The general solution of Eq. (12.10) for angular momentum ` is a linear combination of two particular solutions, one regular with amplitude A` , the spherical Bessel
function j` (%), and one irregular with amplitude B` , the spherical Neumann function
n` (%):
R` (%) = A` j` (%) + B` n` (%) = c` [cos η` j` (%) + sin η` n` (%)] ,

(12.11)

where the new parameters c` and η` , defined by
A` ≡ c` cos η`

and

B` ≡ c` sin η` ,

(12.12)

represent the amplitude c` and the asymptotic phase η` of the wavefunction. Note
that this equation is singular in the origin except for the case of vanishing phase shifts.
Therefore, in the case of free particles we require η` = 0 for all angular momentum
values `. This implies that the general solution reduces to the regular one,
R` (%) = c` cos η` j` (%) .

Significance of the phase shifts

To investigate the effect of a short-range interaction potential V (r) we return to the
radial wave equation (12.6). As the potential is of short range it may be neglected for
r  r0 and the general solutions coincide with those of the spherical Bessel equation,
R` (k, r) −→ c` [cos η` j` (kr) + sin η` n` (kr)] .

where we introduced a the constant η` representing the asymptotic phase shift. For a
given value of k this phase shift fixes the general solution of the radial wavefunction
R` (k, r) up to an ` dependent normalization constant c` . Note that in view of the
k dependence of the phase shift, R` is a function of k and r rather than a function
of the product kr. Whereas in the case of free particles the phase shifts must all
vanish, in the presence of the interaction they provide the proper asymptotic form
of the distorted waves. The non-zero asymptotic phase shift is the signature of the
interaction at short distance; the motion becomes free-particle like (undistorted) only
at large distance from the scattering center. In elastic scattering the relative energy
~2 k 2 /2m is conserved; hence, asymptotically also k and the de Broglie wavelength.
This leaves only the asymptotic phase of the wave to be affected.

we see that for r → ∞ the stationary solution R` (k, r) can be regarded as

Apart from the sign, the ratio of the phase factors of the outgoing over the

S` = e2iη` .

This quantity is called the scattering matrix (S matrix) or, better, the l-wave
contribution to the S matrix. Being unitary it does not suffer from the divergences of the ratio B` /A` = tan η` . In the present context the name scattering
matrix is a bit heavy because we only have a single matrix element (1×1 matrix).
The term matrix finds its origin in the description of scattering of particles with
an internal degree of freedom (like spin), for which the phase factor is replaced
by a unitary matrix.

12.1.2

Hard-sphere potentials

We now turn to analytical solutions for model potentials in the limit of low energy.
We first consider the case of two hard spheres of equal size. These can approach each
other to a minimum distance equal to their diameter a. For r ≤ a the radial wave
function vanishes, R` (r) = 0: Outside the hard sphere we have free atoms, V (r) = 0,
with relative wave number k = [2mr E/~2 ]1/2 . Thus, for r ≤ a the general solution for
the radial wave functions of angular momentum ` is given by the free atom expression
(12.11), which asymptotically this takes the form (12.15) of a phase-shifted spherical
Bessel function,
R` (k, r) = c` [cos η` j` (kr) + sin η` n` (kr)] '

(12.19)

To determine the phase shift we require as a boundary condition that R` (k, r) vanishes
at the surface of the hard sphere (see Fig. 12.3),
cos η` j` (ka) + sin η` n` (ka) = 0 .

(12.20)

Hence, the phase shift follows from the expression,
tan η` =

j` (ka)
.
n` (ka)

(12.21)

This expression allows to derive asymptotic expressions (for ka  1 and for ka  1)
for the radial wave function (12.19), as will be shown in Exc. 12.1.5.1.
12.1.2.1

Figure 12.3: (code) Radial wavefunctions (` = 0) for various values of k (down to the
k → 0 limit) in the case of a hard sphere potential. The boundary condition is fixed by the
requirement that the wavefunction vanishes at the edge of the hard sphere, R0 (ka) = 0.

The phase shift follows from the boundary condition R0 (k, a) = 0, which can be
written in the form,
cos η0 sin ka + sin η0 cos ka = 0 .
(12.23)
Hence, the phase shift is
η0 = −ka .

(12.24)

With this expression Eq. (12.22) reduces to
R0 (k, r) =

c0
sin[k(r − a)] .
kr

(12.25)

This expression is exact for any value of k, as announced above. The linear k dependence of η0 simply expresses its definition in which the shift of the wave (by a) is
compared to the de Broglie wavelength λdB , η0 = −2πa/λdB . As a consequence the
phase shift vanishes for k → 0,
lim η0 (k) = 0 .

k→0

(12.26)

This result is obvious when comparing the finite shift a to the diverging wavelength

This important result is illustrated in Fig. 12.3. In the limit k → 0 the wavefunction

to oscillate), except for a small region of radius a around the potential center.

CHAPTER 12. COLLISIONS

Here |U0 | = κ20 is called the well depth (κ0 is chosen to be real and positive, κ0 > 0).
The energy of the continuum states is given by ε = k 2 . In analogy, the energy of the
bound states is written as,
εb = −κ2 .
(12.29)
We now have to solve the radial wave equation (12.6) with the spherical well potential
(12.28). Since the potential is constant inside the well (r ≤ r0 ) the wavefunction has
to be free-particle like with the wave number given by,
q
p
(12.30)
K+ = 2mr (E − V0 )/~2 = κ20 + k 2 .

As the wavefunction has to be regular in the origin, inside the well it is given by,
R` (r) = C` j` (K+ r)

for r ≤ r0 ,

(12.31)

where C` is a normalization constant. This expression holds for E > V0 (both E > 0
and E ≤ 0).
Outside the well (r > r0 ) we have for E > 0 free atoms, Ṽ (r) = 0, with relative
wavevector k = [2mr E/~2 ]1/2 . Thus, for r > r0 the general solution for the radial
wave functions of angular momentum ` is given by the free atom expression (12.11),
R` (k, r) = c` [cos η` j` (kr) + sin η` n` (kr)]

for r > r0 .

The wavefunctions are not normalized and are shifted relative to each other only for

where we defined the abbreviations %i ≡ K+ r0 and %e ≡ kr0 . This ratio suffices to
determine η` independently of the normalization constants C` and c` . Once the phase
shift is known, the relation between C` and c` follows from the continuity condition
for R` (r). Furthermore, it shows that the asymptotic phase shift η` can take any
(real) value depending on the depth of the well. In view of the importance of the S
matrix in scattering theory Sec. 12.2, it is advantageous to determine e2iη` rather than
η` itself. Expressing sin η` and cos η` in terms of eiη` and e−iη` Eq. (12.33) becomes,

In Exc. 12.1.5.2 we simplify this formula for ` = 0. As the formula (12.35) lacks
transparency from the physical point of view, we analyze in the coming sections the
case ` = 0 directly discussing the radial wavefunctions u` .

s-wave scattering (E > 0)

The analysis of spherical well potentials becomes particularly simple for the case
` = 0. Let us first consider the case E > 0, for which the radial wave equation can
be written as a 1D-Schrödinger equation (12.7) of the form,
u000 + [k 2 − Ṽ (r)]u0 = 0 .

The solution is,

(12.37)

To determine η0 (k) it is sufficient to apply the boundary condition for continuity of
the logarithmic derivative at the edge of the well,
u00
u0

= K+ cot K+ r0 = k cot(kr0 + η0 ) .

(12.38)

r=r0

Note that this expression coincides with the general result given by Eq. (12.33) for
the case ` = 0; i.e. the boundary condition of continuity for u00 /u0 coincides with that
for R00 /R0 , as we know from a calculation left to Exc. 12.1.5.3. Furthermore, for a
vanishing potential (κ0 → 0) we have K+ → k and the boundary condition properly
yields a zero phase shift (η0 = 0).
At this point we introduce the effective hard-sphere diameter a(k) to describe, in
analogy with Eq. (12.24), the behavior of the phase shift,
η0 (k) ≡ −ka(k) .

(12.39)

By this procedure we extract the linear k dependence as well as the negative sign from
the phase shift. This is a good idea because the linear k-dependence does not arise
from the potential but simply from the definition of the phase in which, as discussed
earlier, the shift of the wave is compared to the de Broglie wavelength. In the limit
k → 0, we have K+ r0 → κ0 r0 and with the definition,

(12.42)

where the dimensionless positive quantity,

is called the well parameter. As shown in Fig. 12.5, the value of a can be positive,
negative or zero depending on the value of γ. Therefore, rather than using the pictorial
term effective hard-sphere diameter the name scattering length is used for a. Next to
the range, the scattering length represents the second characteristic length that can be
associated with the interaction potential. As the name suggest, it is a measure for the
scattering behavior of atoms, and we elaborate on this in Sec. 12.2. Also, in Sec. ??
we will show that a is also a measure for the effective strength of the interaction.
Fig. 12.5 and Eq. (12.42) show that a is typically a quantity of the size of r0 ,
although for γ = tan γ it is zero and for γ = (ν + 21 )π, with ν being an integer,

12.1. MOTION OF INTERACTING NEUTRAL ATOMS

351

it diverges. The latter condition points to a resonance phenomenon occurring when
(with increasing γ) a new bound level enters the potential well. For the square
well potential the scattering length is mostly positive; it is negative in the regions
with γ < tan γ, which become narrower for increasing γ. This unlikely occurrence
of negative a is atypical for the general case; e.g. for Van der Waals potentials the
probability to find a negative scattering length is 25% .
For r ≥ r0 the radial wavefunction corresponding to Eq. (12.37) is of the form,
R0 (k, r) =

c0
sin[kr − ka(k)] .

(12.44)

(12.45)

The latter two expressions for the radial wavefunction have the same formal appearance as the hard sphere results (12.25) and (12.27). However, whereas the diameter
of the hard-sphere has a fixed value, the scattering length for the well depends on γ.
As shown in Fig. 12.6, for positive scattering length the s-wave has a characteristic
node at r = a; for negative scattering length this becomes a virtual node.
Importantly, because Eq. (12.45) reaches the asymptotic value 1 only for distances
r  a, the use of this equation in the modeling of dilute gases is only justified if a is
much smaller than the interparticle spacing,
na3  1 .

(12.46)

Otherwise, the interaction with neighboring atoms will distort the relative motion
of the colliding pair. This violates the binary scattering approximation on which
Eq. (12.45) is based. The dimensionless quantity na3 is called the gas parameter.
When its value is small, the gas is called nearly ideal or weakly interacting 2 .
12.1.3.2

Bound s-levels (E ≤ 0)

Let us turn to the case E ≤ 0. We shall show that the divergences of the scattering
length obtained by analyzing the continuum states (E > 0) result from the appearance
of the next bound s-level when increasing the well parameter. The 1D Schrödinger
equation takes the form,
u000 + [−κ2 − Ṽ (r)]u0 (r) = 0 .

(12.47)

where ε = −κ2 is the discrete energy eigenvalue of a bound state with ` = 0. The
solutions are of the type (see Fig. 12.30),
u0 (k, r) =

C0 sin K− r for r ≤ r0

2 Note that weakly interacting does not mean that that the potential is ’shallow’. Any gas can be
made weakly interacting by making the density sufficiently small.

limit for increasing well depth near the threshold value κ0 r0 = (n + 21 )π: (a) presence of
an almost bound state (a < 0); (b) presence of zero-energy resonance (κvb = 0, a → ±∞);
(c) presence of a weakly bound state (a > 0); (d) deeper binding of the least bound state.
For r > r0 the wavefunction is given by u0 (r) = c0 (r − a); hence, the value of a is given
by the intercept with the horizontal axis. This gives rise to a characteristic node at r = a,
which is real for a > 0 (just as for hard spheres of diameter a), but virtual for a < 0. The
wavefunctions are not normalized.

(vmax + 12 )π = Int ( πγ − 12 )
(12.53)
and the total number of bound s levels follows with,
Nb = vmax + 1 = Int ( πγ + 12 ) .

Furthermore, we recall that in the presence of a weakly bound s-level the scattering
length is large and positive, a  r0 . From Eq. (12.41) we recall that for k → 0 the

Interestingly, for a  r0 the logarithmic derivative of the continuum states becomes
independent of r0 and κ0 ; i.e. it becomes independent of the shape of the potential well.
As we shall see it only depends on the well parameter γ and not on the well shape.
This points to a universal limiting shape of the wavefunction for large scattering
length. As is sketched in Fig. 12.8(b), for decreasing κ the least-bound state turns
into a halo state; i.e. for κr0  1 most of the probability of the bound state is found
in the classically inaccessible region outside the potential well, thus surrounding the

potential center like a halo. This behavior holds for arbitrary short-range potentials.

Figure 12.8: Bound states oscillate inside the well and decay exponentially outside the well:
(a) the boundary condition depends on the ratio κ/K− ; (b) a slight reduction of the well
depth can turn the least bound state into a halo state.

With Eqs. (12.56) and (12.57) we have obtained two expressions for κ0 cot κ0 r0 and

length is given by,

The first term of (12.60) is called the background contribution to the phase shift

contribution shows the same phase development as we found in Sec. 12.1.2 for hard
spheres. The phase development of the resonance contribution is shown in Fig. 12.9(a)
for the case of a large well parameter slightly detuned from the threshold value (at
γ = 31.5π ≈ 98.960169) such that the scattering length is negative (∆γ = −0.5).
For potentials with γ  1 the argument of the arctangent is predominantly small,

K+ r0 = κ0 r0 (1 + k 2 /κ20 )1/2 > γ  1 .

However, the argument of the arctangent diverges when cot K+ r0 passes through zero;

Figure 12.9: (code) (a) Resonance contribution to the s-wave phase shift η0 (k) for a large
well parameter slightly detuned from the threshold value (at γ = 31.5π), such that the scattering length is negative (∆γ = −0.5): The linear shift of the background contribution is
not included in the plot. Note that the π phase jumps arise from the modulo-π representation of the arctangent and do not represent an observable phenomenon; the physical phase
increases monotonically and equals ηres = 21 (modulo π) at the center of the resonances; (b)
contribution of the resonances to the effective hard sphere diameter a(k) = −η0 (k)/k. As
(in this example) the lowest resonance is not close to threshold the resonant enhancement is
small, |ares (k)| = r0  1.

where ṽ is an integer called the resonance index. This divergence is observed as a
small resonant enhancement of a(k), as shown in Fig. 12.9(b). The physical phase
is a continuous function of k, which changes by π when sweeping across the resonance. Because the arctangent remains finite for cot K+ r0 = 0 also the resonant
phase shift remains finite, having the value ηres (k) = 12 π (modulo π) at the center of
each resonance.
In the remainder of this section we shall analyze the width and separation of the
s-wave resonances for the case γ  1. Since K+ ≥ κ0 ≥ K− , we have,
ṽ ≥

(12.63)

which shows that for γ  1 the value of ṽ is large (ṽmin ≥ ṽmax  1). Hence, the
resonance numbering starts where the numbering of bound states ends. To discuss
the
p resonances we denote the wavevectors k and K+ at resonance by kres and Kres ≡

The exceptional case for which the equal sign applies (ṽ = vmax ) corresponds to a
resonant bound state (κ = 0) and the resonance is called a resonance at threshold or
zero-energy resonance (kres = 0).
Let us first analyze s-wave resonances for large well parameters (ṽ = vmax ) and
far from threshold, (κ = 0). The energy spacing between two subsequent resonances

For this purpose we introduce the notation,

(12.66)

where δk = k − kres is called the detuning from resonance. Thus, restricting ourselves
to the low-energy (but not zero energy) s-wave resonances (1 < kres r0  Kres r0 ' γ),
we may approximate K+ cot K+ r0 ' Kres cot K+ r0 . Expanding cot K+ r0 about the
zero crossing at K+ r0 = (ṽ + 1/2)π and retaining only the linear term we obtain (see
Problem 3.4),
Kres cot K+ r0 = −δk kres r0 .

is called the spectral width of the resonance. Comparing the expressions for Γ and
∆Eres we find that for given r0 the width Γ is independent of γ, whereas the resonance
spacing is proportional to γ . Thus, only for sufficiently large well parameters (γ  1)
the spectral width becomes smaller than the resonance spacing,
Γ  ∆εres ⇐⇒ kres r0  πγ .

(12.72)

Knowing the tangent of ηres , we readily obtain the sine and Eq. (12.70) is replaced
by the Breit-Wigner formula,
sin2 ηres =

(Γ/2)2
.
(ε − ε0 )2 + (Γ/2)2

(12.73)

For optical resonances this energy dependence is known as the Lorentz lineshape. Note
that Γ corresponds to the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of this line shape.
The lowest energy resonances are plotted in Fig. 12.10 along with the highest-energy
bound states.
The resonance near threshold (almost bound level) deserves special attention, as
this type of resonance is the only one that can play an important role within the band
of energies relevant for the quantum gases (kr0  1). Fig. 12.10 shows that near
the threshold (at γ = 31.5π) the resonance narrows down and becomes asymmetric,
which means that the Breit-Wigner lineshape is lost. Using Eq. (12.54) we calculate
ṽ = 31. The narrow line is reminiscent of a bound level but the scattering length is
negative (see Fig. 12.10). Under these conditions the wavefunction has a virtual node
at r = −|a| (see Fig. 12.30). Accordingly, the level is called a virtual level and the
wavefunction is said to represent a virtual bound state. In analogy with the bound
states its energy is written as ε = κ2res , where κ is to be defined later.

12.1.4

Other types of potentials

12.1.4.1

Zero-range potentials

An important model potential is obtained by considering a spherical well in the zerorange limit r0 → 0. As illustrated in Fig.12.11, it is possible to construct a zero-range
well in such a way that the long-range properties of the wavefunction are unaffected;
i.e. the scattering length a and the binding energy ε = −κ2 of the least-bound state
remain unchanged.
For E < 0 this can be demonstrated with the aid of the boundary condition
(12.49),
−κ = K− cot K− r0 .
(12.74)
Reducing the radius r0 the value of the binding energy ε = −κ2 , can be conserved by
increasing κ0 . In the limit r0 → 0 the well depth should diverge in accordance with,
κ
−
= cot K− r0 → 0 .
(12.75)
K−
This condition is satisfied for K− r0 ' π/2. To elucidate this point we consider the
least-bound level with vibrational quantum number v = vmax , for which K− r0 =

wavefunctions do not share the same normalization.

(vmax + 1/2)π. Reducing r0 by a factor of 2 the wavenumber K− has to be doubled
to conserve the number of nodes in the wavefunction (i.e. to conserve vmax ). This
means that the kinetic energy inside the well has to increases by a factor 4. Since for
the least-bound level we have K− r0 ' γ, it means that in this case the binding energy
can be conserved at effectively constant well parameter. Obviously, the freedom to
conserve (for decreasing r0 ) the binding energy of one of the levels can only be used
once. It does not hold for the other levels because the level separation diverges with
κ0 . In the zero range limit the potential only supports a single bound state and the
wavefunction of that state is given by,
e−κr
for
r>0,
(12.76)

and with κ > 0. Unit normalization, r2 R02 (r)dr = 1, is obtained for c0 = 2κ. For
E > 0 we can arrive at the same conclusion. The boundary condition for k →0 and
given value of r0 is given by Eq. (12.41), which we write in the form,
R0 (r) = c0

1
= κ0 cot κ0 r0 .
r0 − a

(12.77)

Reducing the radius r0 , the scattering length a can be conserved by increasing κ0 . In
the limit r0 → 0 the well depth should diverge in accordance with,

κ0 a

(12.78)

This is again satisfied for κ0 r0 ' π/2. In the zero-range limit the radial wavefunction

for k → 0 is given by,
R0 (k, r) =

(12.79)

which implies R0 (k, r) ' 1 − a/r for 0 < r  1/k.

Note that Eq. (12.76) is the solution for E < 0 of the 1D-Schrödinger equation in the
zero-range approximation,
u000 − κ2 u0

for

r>0,

(12.80)

under the boundary condition,
u00
u0

r→0

= −κ .

(12.81)

The latter relation is called the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition and was first used
to describe the deuteron, the weakly bound state of a proton with a neutron [?]. It
shows that for weakly bound states the wavefunction has the universal form of a halo
state, which only depends on the binding energy, ε0 = −κ2 (see Fig. 12.11).
For E > 0 the 1D-Schrödinger equation in the zero-range approximation is given
by,
u00 + k 2 u0 = 0
for
r>0.
(12.82)
The general solution is u0 (k, r) = c0 sin[kr + η0 ]. Using the Bethe-Peierls boundary
condition we obtain,
k cot η0 (k) = −κ ,
(12.83)

which yields after substituting η0 (k → 0) ' −ka the universal relation between the
scattering length and the binding energy in the presence of a weakly bound s-level,
ε0 = −κ2 = −1/a2 .
12.1.4.3

Power-law potentials

The general results obtained in the previous sections presumed the existence of a finite
range of interaction, r0 . Thus far this presumption was based only on the heuristic
argument presented in Sec. ??. To derive a proper criterion for the existence of a
finite range and to determine its value r0 we have to analyze the asymptotic behavior
of the interatomic interaction [451]. For this purpose we consider potentials of the
power-law type,
Cs
V (r) = − s ,
(12.84)
r
where Cs = V0 rcs is the power-law coefficient, with V0 ≡ |V (rc )| ≡ ~2 κ2c /2mr the well
depth. These power-law potentials are important from the general physics point of
view, because they capture major features of interparticle interactions.
For power-law potentials, the radial wave equation (12.6) takes the form,

Figure 12.12: (code) Dependence of the scattering length on the potential depth.

Because this equation can be solved analytically in the limit k → 0 it is ideally suited
to analyze the conditions under which the potential V (r) may be neglected and thus
to determine r0 . To solve Eq. (12.85) we look for a clever substitution of the variable
r and the function R` (r) to optimally exploit the known r dependence of the potential
in order to bring the differential equation in a well-known form. To leave exibility in
the transformation we search for functions of the type,
G` (x) = r−ν R` (r) ,

(12.86)

where the power ν is to be selected in a later stage.
12.1.4.4

(12.100)

The ansatz U (R) = αεα (R) + βεβ (R) with εα (R → ∞) = R and εβ (R → ∞) = 1

(12.102)

Pseudo potentials

As in the low-energy limit (k → 0) the scattering properties only depend on the
asymptotic phase shift it is a good idea to search for the simplest mathematical
form that generates this asymptotic behavior. The situation is similar to the case of
electrostatics, where a spherically symmetric charge distribution generates the same
far field as a properly chosen point charge in its center. Not surprisingly, the suitable
mathematical form is a point interaction. It is known as the pseudo potential and
serves as an important theoretical Ansatz at the two-body level for the description of
interacting many-body systems [209, 307]. The existence of such pseudo potentials is
not surprising in view of the zero-range square well solutions discussed in Sec. 12.5.
As the pseudo potential cannot be obtained at the level of the radial wave equation,
we return to the full 3D Schrödinger equation for a pair of free atoms,
(∇2 + k 2 )ψk (r) = 0 ,

(12.103)

p

where k = 2mr E/~2 is the wavenumber for the relative motion. Restricting ourselves to s-wave collisions we derived earlier the solution of this equation as being
c0
given by ψk (r) = kr
sin kr. However, we are now looking a solution of the type
(12.37), which includes a phase shift η0 ,
ψk (r) =

c0
sin(kr + η0 ) .
kr

(12.104)

Inserting this expression into the wave equation (12.103) we encounter the problem
that the solution is irregular in the origin when η0 6= 0. Apparently, we need to
complement the wave equation by a (pseudo-)potential to remove this problem.

that the dependence on the relative position vector r rather than its modulus r is purely

do not carry physical significance but are mathematical constructions that can chosen such that they
provide wavefunctions with the proper phase shift.

Scattering theory

In this chapter we discuss scattering by time independent potentials satisfying rV (r →
∞) → 0, that is short-range potentials. Such a potential may have attractive regions
supporting bound states with energy E < 0. Here, however, we only consider states
E > 0. Since the potential is supposed independent of time, ∂t Ĥ = 0, we will focus
on time-independent problems,
Ĥψk (r) = Ek ψk (r) ,

(12.113)

with Ĥ = p2 /2m + V (r) and Ek = ~2 k 2 /2m. The boundary conditions are given
by the scattering geometry in such a way that at long distances the wavefunction
behaves as (see Fig. 12.14),
ψk (r) ∼ eik·r + fk (Ω)

eiks r
.
r

(12.114)

For elastic scattering processes we have ks = k. The scattering amplitude fk (Ω)
depends on the energy Ek and on the scattering solid angle. Experimentally, we
scatter individual particles described by wave packets. Since the scattering theory is
linear, we can describe the packets by superpositions of stationary solutions ψk 6 .

12.2.1

Lippmann-Schwinger equation

In order to consider the example of two particles involved in a collision we may go
into the center-of-mass system (using reduced masses), fix the origin of the coordinate
system on one of the particles, and analyze the trajectory of the second particle inside
the interaction potential.
The scattering theory is based on Green’s method, which we already know from
electrostatics. So, let us start of a brief reminder of the use of the Green’s function
as a method to solve electrostatic problems.
6 Note

that k is not a quantum number, since ψk contains momentum components 6= k.

Green’s method in quantum mechanics

Green’s method can be used to solve Schrödinger’s equation with the boundary condition (12.114). We start from the reduced stationary Schrödinger equation (12.113) [612],
(∆ + k 2 )ψk (r) =

2m
~2 V

(r)ψk (r) .

(12.115)

This equation is not a common eigenvalue problem, since any energy Ek generates a
solution. The equation (12.115) is a partial inhomogeneous differential equation with
the left side describing free propagation and the right side describing a source that
depends on the solution. Such differential equations are usually solved using Green’s
functions. We choose a point source and we solve,
(∆ + k 2 )G(r, k) = δ 3 (r) ,

(12.116)

along with the boundary conditions. The solution takes the form [68],
G(r, k) = −

The equation (12.118) is called Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Of course, this equation does not solve, but only reformulate the problem taking into account the boundary conditions. It is more appropriate for an implementation of approximations. See
Exc. 12.2.7.1 and 12.2.7.2.
Now let us consider the far field, r → ∞, to verify the asymptotic behavior and
find an expression for fk (Ω) as a function of V (r). For r → ∞ we can approximate

The time evolution of the wavefunction ψ(r, t) determines the signal measured by a
detector at a later time t = t0 . Our task is to determine ψ(r, t > t0 ). The scattered
states ψk solving the Schrödinger equation (12.113) are complete in the space of the
extended wavefunctions, and we can write the temporal evolution as,

The scattering process is illustrated in Fig. 12.15: According to the last equation
the scattering process involves the superposition of the non-scattered packet and a
packet scattered in the direction Ω. The latter involves the amplitude Ψ0 (k̂0 r, t) of
a packet propagating in forward direction, which only needs to be evaluated at the
right time and distance. This packet will then be multiplied with the amplitude
describing the angular dependency fk0 ; the angle, therefore, only appears through
this amplitude and not in the wavefunction ψ0 . In two situations the above analysis
can not be applied :
 when V is long-ranged, f.ex., V = 1/r,
 when the incident energy Ek is resonant.

Spherical potentials

For spherically symmetric scattering potentials, V (r) = V (r), the Hamiltonian Ĥ =
p2 /2m + V (r) commutes with the rotation operators Uω~ = e−i~ω·L/~ around any axis
êω~ . Therefore, we can separate the angular problem and decompose the scattering
problem following the irreducible representations of the rotation group. This partial
wave decomposition can be written,
ψk (r) =

(2` + 1)i` P` (cos θ)Rl (r) ,

(12.136)

`=0

where the factor (2` + 1)i` is a convention facilitating the calculation later on. By
inserting this separation ansatz for the radial and angular variables into the stationary
Schrödinger equation (12.113), we obtain the radial Schrödinger equation,

To determine the coefficients α` and s` we note first that, without potential,
V (r) = 0, the solution of the radial equation (12.137) is known,
(2)

(1)

R` (r) = j` (kr) = 21 [h` (kr) + h` (kr)] ,

such that α` = 21 and s` = 1. For V (r) 6= 0 the incident wave h` is the same, but
(1)
not the incident h` , which results in s` 6= 1. However, particle number conservation
requires that the number of particles entering the potential is equal to the number of
particles coming out. That is, the total radial flow must be,

CHAPTER 12. COLLISIONS

Now comparing the case V = 0 giving R` (r) = j` (kr) with the case V 6= 0 giving
R` (r) ∼ eiδ` j` (kr + δ` ), we notice that a positive displacement, δ` > 0, pulls the
wavefunction into the potential, while a negative displacement, δ` < 0, pushes the
wavefunction out, as illustrated in Fig. 12.16.

Figure 12.16: Phase shift δ` (k) of the scattered wavefunction. (a) An attractive potential
increases the kinetic energy and the wavefunction oscillates faster, which causes a positive
phase shift and a negative scattering length. (b) A repulsive potential slows down the wavefunction oscillation and produces a positive scattering length. (c,d) In an attractive potential
deep enough to support vibrational states, the wavefunction performs several oscillations.
The sign of the scattering length then depends on the distance of the last bound state to
the continuum.

With this we obtain the optical theorem,
σ=

k Im

f (0) .

(12.151)

The deeper meaning of the optical theorem is the conservation of particle number:
The flux of scattered particles, (~k/m)σ = Isct , must be extracted from the incident
flux I0 by scattering, and therefore, is missing in the forward direction. It is the
interference of the scattered wave with the incident wave, which diminishes the nonscattered wave and therefore creates a shadow of the scatterer in the forward direction.
The particles missing in the shadow of the scatterer are precisely those that have been
scattered. This is the message of the optical theorem, which is always valid in the
absence of possible (inelastic) processes leading to trapping or a transformation of the
particles.

Born approximation for the scattering phase

The scattering problem can be considered as solved when we know the scattering
amplitude fk (θ), since this quantity gives us the flux measured by the detector. Now,
fk (θ) is known, when we know the scattering phases δ`,k . These are, in general,
determined by integrating the radial equation (12.137). Here, we expect that only
angular momenta ` < kR0 (R0 is the range of potential) produce significant phase
shifts. Particles with larger angular momenta have collision parameters b ∼ `/k
out of the potential reach. We notice that partial s-waves are always scattered,
whereas partial p-waves (or higher) are only weakly scattered when the energy is
weak, E < ~2 /2mR02 . In these cases an approximate calculation of δ` is sufficient:

The result (12.153) is the Born approximation for the scattering phase δ` (k). Note
that R` ' j` is not a good approximation, in ranges where V is large and R` strongly
suppressed (f.ex., inside hard cores). For ` large we have j` ∼ r` , and δ` is small for
a limited potential V (r).

R` (r) = 12 [h` (kr) + s` h` (kr)] ,

(12.154)

while for r < R0 the solution R` must be found by integrating the radial equation
(12.137). The scattering phase s` must be chosen in a way that R` and ∂r R` be

In summary, for kinetic energies below the centrifugal barrier, only s-wave collisions are significant. The higher-order partial waves are frozen behind the centrifugal
barrier. That is, the energy of cold collisions is not enough to excite a rotational
motion, not even the one with the lowest rotational energy allowed by quantum mechanics. Such a collision is called cold collision or s-wave collision.
R→∞ −1

The relative wavefunction tends asymptotically to ψ(R) −→ kdB

R − a. This means that for temperatures so low that the length of the Broglie wave
−1
of the relative motion is much longer than the potential range kdB
 Rturning , the
scattering becomes independent of temperature, and the scattering length a becomes
well defined 10
Generally, a repulsive interaction potential corresponds to a positive scattering
length and an attractive potential to a negative one. However, if the attractive potential supports bound states, the value of the scattering length depends on the energy
of the last bound state with respect to the dissociation threshold [637, 638].

12.3.1

Collision cross section, unitarity regime

Note that the scattering length a may have a value quite different from re , especially
in the presence of a Feshbach resonance. The meaning of universality, |a|  re , is
that short-range properties play no role in the dynamics.
At low temperatures, kre → 0, we have the equation (12.169). In contrast, in the
unitarity limit, k → ∞, but re → 0, we have,
σ=

and the cross section becomes independent of atomic particularities. What the equation (12.169) says is, that the maximum attainable cross-section is limited to the

difference between an atom before and after an elastic collision is the phase shift δ0 of this wave.

Note that at the unitary limit, as v̄ ∝ T , we have that σelas ∝ T and n0 ∝ r̄−3 ∝
T −3/2 , such that the collision rate is independent of temperature.
At low temperatures, k → 0, the delocalization of the colliding particles is greater
than its short-range structure. This is the Wigner threshold law [651, 644]. For
elastic collisions of neutral ground state atoms, the cross section (12.169)√ becomes
temperature-independent. Thus, the rate coefficient decreases as hσv̄i ∝ T , while
the collision rate increases as hσv̄n0 i ∝ T −1 .
For inelastic collisions, σ ∝ T −1 . For three-body collisions see [206].

Collisions between identical particles

We consider collisions of two identical particles. Separating the center-of-mass coordinates, R = r1 + r2 , from the relative ones, r = r1 − r2 , we see that R is symmetric
and r antisymmetric in r1 and r2 . We separate the wavefunction into orbital and spin
parts,
Ψ(x1 , x2 ) = eiP·R ψ(r)χ(s1 , s2 ) .

 Molecules H2 : the nuclei are spin- 21 fermions, so we have for a spin wavefunction,

Photoassociation during ultracold collisions

Ultra-cold collisions are an interesting example of how light can control the result of
inelastic or reactive collisions. Here we discuss as a specific example the photoassociation, which illustrates the utility of the dressed states pictures. The upper panel

or long-range van der Waals potential. Two other molecular states arise from the
interaction of an excited atom with the ground state atom. The predominant term of
the interaction is the potential of resonant dipole-dipole interactions,
V2,3 (r) = − ∓

C3
.
R3

(12.191)

which gives rise to an attractive and a repulsive potential. The R−3 dependence of the
resonant dipole interaction means that the associated potentials greatly modify the
asymptotic level even at internuclear distances where the ground state van der Waals
potential is still relatively shallow. The photoassociation process involves a slow approach of two identical ground state atoms. A mono-modal optical field, tuned to the
red of the atomic resonance, is applied. When the two atoms reach an internuclear
distance RC such that the energy of the applied field ~ωC exactly coincides with the
potential difference V2 (Rc ) − V1 (Rc ), the probability of transferring population from
the fundamental molecular state to the excited molecular state is maximal. This
molecular resonance is sometimes called Condon point. The conventional way of calculating this probability follows the procedure elaborated in Sec. 13.1 for a two-level
atom. First, we would solve the time-independent molecular Schrödinger equation
to obtain the molecular wavefunctions. Then, write down the coupled differential
equations by describing the time dependence of the expansion coefficients of the relevant molecular wavefunctions, solve for the coefficients and calculate the square of
their absolute values. Finally, we would need to integrate the transition probability
inside a region ∆R around the Condon point, where the transition probability is not
be negligible. The dressed states picture allows to reduce this rather laborious program, essentially, to a problem of a curve crossing of two levels. The bottom panel
of Fig. 12.22 illustrates the photoassociation in the dressed states picture. The basis
states are now product states made up of the field and the molecular levels. Furthermore, we approximate the molecular states themselves as products of atomic states.
This approximation is justified by the long range, weakly perturbative influence of
the van der Waals and resonant dipoles interactions. Calling the ground and excited
states |1i and |2i, respectively, we have
|1, ni = |1k1i|ni ,

(12.192)

and for the field-molecule excited state
|2, n − 1i = |2k1i|n − 1i .

(12.193)

The two molecular curves intersect at the Condon point and optically couple to the
applied field. This optical coupling produces an avoided crossing near RC and mixes
the states of the molecule-field basis. The well-known Landau-Zener formula (LZ)
expresses the probability of traversing from one adiabatic molecular state to another
as a function of the interaction strength, the relative velocity of the collision partners,

12.3. COLD ATOMIC COLLISIONS

383

and the relative slopes of the two curves. The probability of LZ is given by,

transition. A reasonable approximation is to take the moment of molecular transition

At short distances the coupling ((S, I)f1 , f2 )f breaks up and a ((s1 , s2 )S, I)f coupling
emerges. This does not hold for fully stretched spin states f1 + f2 = f , because f
is a good quantum number at all distances (and small enough magnetic fields). In
contrast mf is a good quantum number at all distances and at all fields.
In order to obtain the potentials coupled by hyperfine interaction, we first calculate
for a single vibrational level the relative wavefunctions |ψ(f1 ,f2 )f (R)i from the known
perturbed but uncoupled potentials V (R) + Vhf , where,
Vhf = hahf,1 s1 ·i1 + hahf,2 s2 ·i2 .

CHAPTER 12. COLLISIONS

12.3.9

Inelastic collisions

12.3.9.1

Spin changing collisions

These have their origin in spin exchange and spin dipole-dipole processes. Spin
exchange occurs when the colliding electronic clouds overlap. At short distances
the ((S, I)f1 , f2 )f breaks up and a ((s1 , s2 )S, I)f coupling remixes, as shown in
Exc. 11.3.5.1. Hence, collisions between atoms |f1 , mf 1 i|f2 , mf 2 i are subject to
spin exchange induced by coupling of the spin states via the exchange interaction,
e.g. |2, 1i|2, 1i → |2, 2i|2, 0i. Typical exchange rates are on the order of 10−10 cm3 /s.
Since f is a good quantum number at all distances (for B = 0), spin exchange
processes conserve ` and f . Hence, the fully stretched spin states f1 + f2 = f cannot
decay into other states, except by higher-order processes, such as dipolar relaxation.
Consequently, the relaxation rates for |2, 2i + |2, 2i or |1, −1i + |1, −1i states are only
on the order of 10−15 cm3 /s.
The cross section for inelastic spin exchange collisions is [647, 133],

as and at determine the energy of the last bounds states of the singlet and triplet
potentials. The more those energies are different, the stronger the coupling ∝ |Et −
Es |−1 . An alternative, physical picture is given in [98].
12.3.9.2

Dipolar relaxation

The fully stretched spin states, such as 87 Rb |f = 2, mf = 2i are expected to be quite
stable. However, relativistic effects (retardation?) (and 2nd order spin-orbit coupling)
break the degeneracy of the molecule-fixed projection |Ω| = 0, 1 of the 3 Σ potential
[426]. When the atoms approach their spins recouple, i.e. from [(s1 , i1 )f1 , (s2 , i2 )f2 ]f
towards [(s1 , s2 )s , (i1 , i2 )i]f as described by the 9j coefficients Eq. (12.197). Due to
the symmetry of the problem, f and its projection mf are good quantum numbers
at all distances. However, if there is a higher-order admixture of the orbit lj , the
symmetry is broken, and the quantum number depends on the coupling schemes.
Consequently, transitions between different mf become possible, i.e. dipolar relaxation
may change f , mf or ` = 0, e.g. a collision can be s-wave in the entrance and d-wave
in the exit channel.
12.3.9.3

Three-body collisions

The trapped low-field seeking alkali gases are metastable versus 3-body recombination.
3-body recombination is the combination of two colliding atoms to a dimer in presence

12.3. COLD ATOMIC COLLISIONS

387

of a third atom receiving the excess energy as kinetic energy and results in trap loss
of the molecule and of the atom. They are suppressed as the gas gets more and
more dilute since the rate goes like n3 . There might be interesting 3-body resonance
phenomena like the Efimov state predicted for Helium droplets [196], [385] and recently
seen in experiment [369, 601, 87, 394].
3-body recombination is in contrast to the more controlled way of creating molecules
via photoassociation or coherent free-bound coupling.
Ultracold collisions are crucial for BEC. They provide the thermalizing elastic
collisions necessary for evaporative cooling, they are the cause for the condensate
self-energy and give rise to nonlinearities in the condensate dynamics. But they
are also interesting by themselves. The spectrum of two-body collisions exhibits
interesting features like shape- and Feshbach resonances [137, 312]. Their analysis
facilitates detailed conclusions on the nature of the interaction potentials. Three body
collisions are important to investigate, because they constitute a decay mechanism of
the intrinsically metastable system that represents a trapped Bose-gas.
Three body collisions are not a quantum statistical effect and don’t require the
presence of a BEC, but they occur only at very high densities comparable to those
necessary for BEC. It should be possible to detect them in photoassociation (PA)
spectra. Photoassociation provides a tool to explore the level structure of excited
states by shining in a laser with frequency ν tuned between the colliding channel
and a vibrational bound level of the excited state potential. Since the excited state
preferentially decays into the continuum, where the atoms have high kinetic energy,
the transition rate may be monitored via trap losses. Or we can shine in an additional
laser that further excites the excited atoms into the ionized continuum where they
can be registered by an ion detector.
Three-body photoassociation processes should reveal themselves by additional
lines in the two-body photoassociation spectra. Those lines should only appear at
very high densities and their strength should scale as the density cubed,
Rb + Rb + Rb + hν → Rb∗3 .
12.3.9.4

(12.208)

Other processes

Majorana spin flips and collisions involving higher partial waves ` can eventually lead
to spin relaxation. In Eq. (11.90) we see that f is not necessarily a good quantum
number in contrast to F , |2, 2i|2, 2i → |2, 1i|2, 0i + Erot . However, the particles must
tunnel across the centrifugal barrier, which sets temperature constraints.
12.3.9.5

Collisions between fermions

Very cold three-body collisions are suppressed for fermions, because two of them
necessarily must have the same quantum state, which violates the Pauli exclusion
principle. This is useful for employing Feshbach resonances to form molecular BECs
made of fermions.

Heteronuclear electric dipole moment

The electric dipole moment of a dimer is highest for big mass difference, as in the case
of LiRb and for low vibrational quantum number [363, 25]. The electric dipole moment

Resonances in cold collisions

12.4.1

Shape resonances

The ’centrifugal’ term can give rise to repulsive walls for attractive potentials. Behind these walls, quasi-bound states can develop and give rise to collision resonances.
That is, resonances emerge in the collision cross section as a function of the collision
temperature called shape resonances.

12.4.2

Feshbach resonances

The so-called Feshbach resonance is due to an energetic match between a collision
channel and a bound molecular state [210, 615, 616, 437, 208, 438, 629]. They allow
to vary the scattering length as almost arbitrarily from zero, where the atomic cloud
turns into an ideal gas, up to values exceeding the total size of the cloud.

Figure 12.28: Classical illustration of a scattering resonance.

The impact of a Feshbach resonance can be understood as a perturbation of the
collisional channel leading to a modification of the depth of the scattering potential.
When this leads to the promotion of one more vibrational state into (or from) the
continuum, this obviously leads to a dramatic modification of the scattering length
as 14
Let us consider two very cold atoms colliding on an attractive interatomic potential
V (R) (see Fig. 12.29,right). At long distances the relative wavefunction is a sine
characterized by the Broglie wave vector kdB . As the atoms approach each other, they
mutually accelerate, and the Broglie wave performs some small and rapid oscillations
within the potential. The number of nodes of the wavefunction within the potential
corresponds to the number of bound vibrational levels that the potential with a given
depth can support. The scattering length as is defined as the phase slip, which the
Broglie wave would acquire during the collision at the boundary kdB → ∞.
With the possibility of gradually decreasing the depth of the molecular potential,
at some point the last state below the ionization threshold goes to the continuum of
unbound states, the wavefunction decreases the number of nodes by one unit, while
the scattering cross section crosses a singularity. In fact, the potential V (R) can
14 Note that the divergence of the scattering length is an artifact of the hard core approximation,
that is, the regularization of the interaction potential, since the matrix T by itself does not diverge.

Feshbach resonance, by magnetic fields [616, 617]. Feshbach resonances were predicted
in nuclear systems [210]. Its recent revival in the context of cold atomic collisions is due
to the prospect of its use for manipulating the scattering length and thus controlling
the mean-field energy of a Bose-Einstein condensate 15

The collisional Feshbach resonance arises when the energy of the state of two
colliding atoms coincides with the energy of a vibrational molecular level belonging
to a higher energy asymptote (see Fig. 12.29,right). This coincidence can strongly
perturb the collisional channel, because the resonance shifts the phase of the relative
de Broglie wavefunction and allows the atoms to tunnel into the molecular state
for a short period of time, the duration of which is determined by the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation. If the sum of the magnetic dipole moments of the atoms is
15 It

is even possible to invert the sign of the scattering length. This was a prerequisite for condensation of the atomic species of 85 Rb [527]. In addition, Feshbach resonances are interesting because
they can install a coherent free-bound coupling between an open-channel of colliding atoms and a
bound molecular state of the same atoms, as shown in Fig. 12.29. This coupling can lead to the
creation of molecular condensates.

different from the dipole moment of the molecule, the resonance can be tuned via
external magnetic fields exploring the Zeeman effect. When a Feshbach resonance is
crossed, the scattering length crosses a singularity, as shown in Fig. 12.30(left) 16 .

Interaction of light with
mono-electronic atoms
In Secs. 1.2 we introduced the Einstein coefficients A and B, which we associated
with Planck’s spectral distribution of black-body radiation. This procedure allowed
us to connect the coefficients for spontaneous and stimulated transitions, but did not
provide any method to calculate them from the intrinsic properties of the atoms.
The purpose of this chapter is to find expressions for the rates of absorption and
emission of atomic radiation using quantum mechanics and to relate them to the
Einstein coefficients. As for all rates, we will find that these rates should be expressed
in terms of probabilities for absorption and emission. Several disciplines such as
spectrometry, spectroscopy and astrophysics have developed their own terminologies
to describe absorption and emission of light by matter. We will explain how the most
frequently used parameters are interrelated by placing particular emphasis on the
simplest system, which is the two-level atom with no degeneracy and no spin.

13.1

Semiclassical theory of the excitation of atomic
transitions

In a model of an isolated atom, the atomic energy levels are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and describe the system completely, i.e. they do not undergo any evolution. To
accurately describe an atom, one has to consider its coupling to the field of the electromagnetic vacuum. The total system has different eigenstates and their projection
on the unperturbed eigenstates changes over time. We will show in the following, that
an excited atomic state has a constant probability, depending on the coupling to the
electromagnetic field, to decay to another state. Thus, the probability of measuring
a specific lifetime follows a Poisson distribution.

13.1.1

Time-dependent perturbation by a plane wave

Looking at the Hamiltonian (9.11) describing the interaction of a charged particle
with an electromagnetic field, we find that the term A · ∇ ∝ eıωt oscillates with
frequency ω, while the term A2 ∝ e2iωt oscillates with twice that frequency. We will
only consider the interaction term (9.12), which is linear in A, and we will treat this
term as first-order perturbation by time-dependent perturbation theory (TPDT).
399

multiply Wf i by ~ω and, hence, we can define the cross section for the absorption of

(13.18)

The fact that, in a coupled atom-radiation system in equilibrium, the radiation field
excites the same number of transitions in absorption i → f as in stimulated emission
f → i is called the principle of detailed balance.
Obviously, the situation is different, if instead of two states we have several states
that can be excited by radiation or decay.

13.1.3

Spontaneous emission

Absorption and stimulated emission are due to the interaction of the atom with a
radiation field. There is another emission process due to interaction with fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum called spontaneous emission. This interaction
is understood in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. Here, we will adopt a
heuristic treatment.
Replacing in Eq. (13.17) the intensity by the number of photons (13.8), we obtain,
(st)

Wif

=

π~e2 N (ω)
|Mf i |2 δ(ω − ωf i ) .
ε0 m2 ωV

(13.19)

In fact, the introduction of the concept of photons already implies the quantization
of the electromagnetic field. Adding to the number of photons a photon representing
the vacuum fluctuations, N (ω) −→ N (ω) + 1, we are able to include spontaneous
emission,
π~e2 [N (ω) + 1]
(st)
(sp)
Wif + Wif =
|Mf i |2 δ(ω + ωf i ) .
(13.20)
ε0 m2 ωV
This means that even in the absence of a classical radiation field, N (ω) = 0, there
(sp)
is an emission probability. We note that Wif depends on the volume confining the
atom, that is, the cavity, since it describes the transfer of energy to this volume. Here,
it is clear that an argument is still missing, because the transfer rate must depend
in some way on the number of states available to accommodate the emitted photon,
that is, on the density of states within the cavity. The calculation of this density of
states should allow us to evaluate the quantization volume V .
13.1.3.1

Density of states

To estimate the number of modes, that is, of photonic states within a solid angle
dΩ of free space, we consider a cubic box of size L. The modes within this volume

13.2. DIPOLAR TRANSITIONS

wavefunctions e−ik·r ,
(13.21)
kx,y,z = 2π
L nx,y,z ,
where (nx , ny , nz ) is a set of integers representing the various states of the photon.
In the limit of large L the variation between successive k is very small, such that we
can treat the numbers as continuous variables. That is, the number of states with k
between (kx , ky , kz ) and (kx + dkx , ky + dky , kz + dkz ) is,

Dipolar transitions

13.2.1

Dipolar approximation

So far, we have used the matrix element Mfλi (ωf i ) without saying how it can be
calculated, nor when it is significant. In many cases of interest the calculation of this
matrix element is considerably simplified by an expansion of the term e−ık·r , which

404 CHAPTER 13. INTERACTION OF LIGHT WITH MONO-ELECTRONIC ATOMS
is part of the matrix element (13.12) 3 ,
e−ık·r = 1 − ık · r −

2! (k

· r)2 + ... .

(13.26)

This expansion is justified by the fact that the wavelength (∼ 600 nm in the visible
spectrum) is much larger than the size of the scattering atom, kaB  1. The dipolar
approximation supposes,
e−ık·r ' 1 ,
(13.27)
such that we can remove the spatial dependence. In this approximation there is only
an interaction of the electric field of the radiation with the atom via an electric dipole

The interpretation of the last equation is, that the states |ii and |f i are connected
through a displacement of the electronic cloud which, therefore, represents the induction of an electric dipole during the electronic transition. It is convenient to introduce
the electric dipole moment 4 .

Polarization dependence

Following Eq. (13.31) the absorption rate depends on the orientation of the dipole
moment with respect to the polarization of light, which therefore plays an important
role in this transition. When df i between two states is zero, the transition via electric
dipole radiation is prohibited. This is not to say that there is no transition, since other
terms of the expansion (13.26) are not necessarily zero, and there may be transitions of
higher multipolar orders. Even the matrix element Mfλi (ωf i ) being zero for transitions
involving one photon, there is still the possibility of two-photon transitions.

13.2.1.2

Einstein transition probabilities

Considering the problem of the transfer of energy between the electromagnetic field
and a sample of atoms in thermal equilibrium, Einstein realized that the processes
of absorption and stimulated emission are not sufficient to understand the radiative
coupling between two energy levels, that is, the coupling is not correctly described by
Fermi’s Golden rule, and we need to introduce the notion of spontaneous emission.
Differently from the derivation of the preceding section, Einstein considered atoms
whose populations of energy states are in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field of a black-body. With this picture he came to the same result for the
spontaneous emission rate (13.35). The famous Einstein coefficients Af i and Bf i are
given by,
~ωf3 i
Af i
(sp)
Af i Nf = W f i
and
= 2 3 ,
(13.39)
Bf i

where Nf is the population of the excited state. This shows that, in fact, spontaneous
emission is a necessary consequence of the interaction of an atom with a thermal bath
(also called reservoir).

13.2.2

Einstein transition probabilities

We now consider the problem of energy transfer between an electromagnetic field and
a sample of atoms. The rate of absorption of a light field is,
Ri→f ≡ 13 Ṗi→f =

π 2
E |df i |2 %(ωf i ) ,
6~2 0

(13.40)

13.2. DIPOLAR TRANSITIONS

407

with W0 = E0 df i and df i being the transition matrix element between atomic states.
The factor 13 comes from the fact that the vector E~ of the electric field can have any
polarization, but only polarizations along the direction of the oscillation of the dipole
moment contribute.
For a single atom, the result (13.40) is symmetric with respect to an exchange of
the initial and final states, that is, the rates for absorption and induced emission of
light are the same. For a sample of atoms being in thermal equilibrium, the populations Ni of the ground state and Nf of the excited state are unequal according to
Boltzmann’s law. Therefore, as we have shown in Sec. 1.2.5,
Nf Rf →i 6= Ni Ri→f .

(13.41)

Thus, Einstein came to the conclusion that Fermi’s golden rule correctly describes
absorption, but does not contain all contributions of emission. The rates being related
to the Einstein coefficients by the equation (1.65), we find,
Rf →i = Bf i Nf u(ωf i )

13.2.3

Selection rules and electronic transitions

The selection rules that determine which transitions between two sets of quantum
numbers i → f are allowed, reflect the symmetry properties of the system, e.g., the
conservation of angular momentum (including the spin of the photon) or the change
of parity, which can be understood by the fact that the emission of a photon in a
particular direction must in some way alter the spatial isotropy of the atom. Note
that symmetric oscillations of the shape of the charge distribution do not radiate.
Since the electronic transitions via electric dipole radiation are described by |ˆ
 ·rf i |,
we expect a strong dependence between the polarization state of the light and the
existence of a displacement rf i in the transition between states. Let us express ˆ

13.2. DIPOLAR TRANSITIONS

409

This is the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The electric dipole operator is a simpler example
of a tensor operator Qqκ (r) characterizing the transition between atomic states. In
Excs. 13.2.6.2 and 13.2.6.3 we explicitly calculate, for a hydrogen atom subjected to
a magnetic field, components of the electric dipole operator.
Selection rules may be violated in higher orders, e.g., by multipolar radiation, as
in the cases of magnetic dipole transitions or electric quadrupole transitions. This
also is the case of the phenomenon of phosphorescence, which is a type of fluorescence
emitted by metastable states.
13.2.3.1

Parity

The parity of a state has been defined as,
Pψn`m (r) = ψn`m (−r) = (−1)` ψn`m (r) ,

(13.54)

as shown above. That is, states with ` pair (impair) have even (odd) parity. Now
the integral (13.53) only does not vanish, when `i + `f + 1 = even. Therefore, dipole
transitions must change the parity of the states. F.ex., transitions S → P would be
possible, while S → S would be prohibited.
13.2.3.2

Angular momentum

In the decomposition (13.53) with κ = 1 the first Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is only
non-zero, when |`f − `i | ≤ 1 ≤ `f + `i . That is, dipole transitions can not change the
angular momentum by more than one unit.
13.2.3.3

Magnetic quantum number

In the decomposition (13.53) with κ = 1 the second Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is
only non-zero, when |q| ≤ 1. That is, dipole transitions can not change the magnetic
quantum number by more than one unit. This can also be seen from,

are possible, we must look at the matrix hJ 0 m0J |ẑ|JmJ i. Applying the Wigner-Eckart
theorem (9.71), it is already possible to determine, between which magnetic quantum
numbers mJ and m0J transitions may occur.
We can compare the amplitudes of the various transitions between states |mJ i
and |m0J i via the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (see Exc. 9.3.2.1). Transitions are only
possible between states for which the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient does
not zero. This is called selection rule. Looking at the equations (9.73), we find for
dipolar transitions the following selection rules,
∆J = 0, ±1 mas (J = 0) → (J = 0) is prohibited

(13.58)

∆mJ = 0, ±1 mas (mJ = 0) → (mJ = 0) is prohibited when ∆J = 0 .
In addition, we have for the L · S coupling,
∆S = 0, ∆L = ±1 and for the electron undergoing the transition ∆l = ±1 .
(13.59)
In the presence of a strong magnetic field (Paschen-Back regime) breaking up the
L · S-coupling the selection rules are,
∆mS = 0, ∆mL = 0, ±1 .

(13.60)

For j · j-coupling,
∆j = 0, ±1 for one electron and ∆j = 0 for all others .

(13.61)

For all dipole transitions the parity must change between even and odd.
Example 56 (Transitions allowed and prohibited in the dipolar approximation): Examples of allowed transitions are 2 S1/2 ↔2 P1/2 , 1 S0 ↔1 P0 .
Prohibited transitions are 1 S0 =3 P1 , 2 S1/2 =2 D3/2 , (5s)2 3 P0 = (5s6s) 3 P0 .

dependence into account, we decompose the polarization vector (which can be linear or
elliptical) on a coordinate basis, as shown in Eq. (13.47). Thus, the relative amplitude
of the transitions ∆mJ = 0 is proportional to the projection of the polarization vector
onto the magnetic field axis, 0 ≡ ˆ
 · ê0 . To estimate the amplitude of the transitions
∆mJ = ±1, we must project onto the coordinates ±1 ≡ ˆ

is a Lorentz distribution. Note, that the natural linewidth can be blurred by line
broadening effects, such as the Doppler broadening or collisions between atoms. These
effects will be discussed in the Chp. 14.6.1.
Excited states can sometimes decay into various states of lower energy. In this
case the linewidth is simply given by the sum of the partial decay rates, since the
convolution of Lorentz
P distributions LΓk with widths Γk is again a Lorentzian with
the total width Γ = k Γk .

13.3.2

Beyond perturbative treatment

We look for an equation to describe the temporal evolution of atoms interacting with
a radiation field. However, to portray systems that contain excitation and relaxation
processes occurring simultaneously, a theory based on Schrödinger’s equation is no
longer sufficient, because it is only capable of explaining stimulated processes, such
as the absorption of a monochromatic wave. Dissipative process, such as spontaneous
emission, require a more general approach to describe the evolution of a system.
A single wavefunction is, in general, not enough to represent such a system nor to
quantify the probabilities associated with each of its states, but we rather need an
ensemble of wavefunctions.
A comprehensive formalism, capable of dealing with ensembles of wavefunctions
and dissipative processes is the so-called density operator formalism. The dynamics

13.3. SPECTRAL LINES AND LIFETIMES

415

of the density operator is ruled by the Bloch equations [69], which provide equations
of motion for the temporal evolution of populations, described by the diagonal terms
of the operator, and coherences of the system, represented by the non-diagonal terms,
as we shall see in the next chapter. The Bloch equations were initially developed to
understand nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomena.

13.3.3

Line and oscillator strength

In addition to the Einstein coefficients A21 , B21 , and B12 , the amplitude of the transition dipole moments d12 and the absorption cross-section σ0a (ω), three other quantities are sometimes used to characterize atomic transitions: the oscillator strength
f , the line strength S, and the spectral absorption cross section σω . In the following
sections, we will connect these different concepts.
The line strength S is defined as the square of the transition dipole moment
summed over all degeneracies of the ground and excited states,
X
S12 = S21 =
|hψ1,m1 |d|ψ2,m2 i|2 .
(13.76)
m1 ,m2

The notion of the line strength becomes significant when working with real atoms
characterized by degenerate ground and excited states. In such cases we need to
extend the meaning of d12 and consider transitions between each of the degenerate
sublevels. For a non-degenerate two-level atom, the quantities d12 and A21 are simply
related by,
ω03
d2 .
(13.77)
A21 =
3π0 ~c3 12
If the lower level would be degenerate, the spontaneous emission rate coefficient would
be given by the sum of all possible deexcitation rates. In this case, d212 is defined as
the sum of the elements of the transition matrix coupling the excited and the lower
states,
X
d212 =
|hψ1,m1 |d|ψ2 i|2 .
(13.78)
m1

Now, it can be shown that the spontaneous emission rate from any sublevel of a
degenerate excited state toward a lower level (that is, the sum over all lower sublevels)
is the same for all excited sublevels 8 This statement reflects the intuitively plausible
idea that spontaneous emission must be isotropic and unpolarized, if the sublevels
of an excited state are uniformly populated. Therefore, the insertion of Eq. (13.78)
into (13.77) should produce correct results, even when the excited state is degenerate.
Comparing the sum over all upper and lower degeneracies with the line strength S,
X
S12 =
|hψ1,m1 |d|ψ2,m2 i|2 = g2 d212 .
(13.79)
m1 ,m2

Therefore, the insertion of Eq. (13.79) into (13.77) must be accompanied by a factor
of 1/g2 to correct for the fact that all excited sub-levels radiate at the same rate.
8 This applies to Zeeman sublevels (summing up (3j)-coefficients). Check for other degeneracy
(also summing up {6j}-coefficients)!

416 CHAPTER 13. INTERACTION OF LIGHT WITH MONO-ELECTRONIC ATOMS
Therefore, using the S12 of Eq. (13.79) the correct expression relating the transition
dipole between degenerate levels to the spontaneous emission rate is,
S12 = g2

3π0 ~c3
A21 ,
ω03

(13.80)

meaning that the line strength is proportional to the sum of the spontaneous emission
rates A21 from each one of the g2 excited levels toward all fundamental levels.
For an atom with two levels separated by an energy ~ω0 the oscillator strength for
emission is defined as a measure for the radiative decay rate A21 as compared to the
radiative decay rate γe of a classical electronic oscillator with frequency ω0 :
f21 = −

1 A21
.
3 γe

(13.81)

In case of degeneracy the oscillator strength for absorption is consequently defined by,
f12 = −

g2
g2 A21
f21 =
.
g1
3g1 γe

(13.82)

The transitions S ←→ P in real atoms behave roughly as classical oscillators, that
is, A21 ' γe . The factor 13 in the definition compensates for the triple degeneracy of
the P levels. So, a transition S ←→ P which behaves exactly as a classical oscillator
would be characterized by an oscillator strength for emission of f21 = − 13 and an
oscillator strength for absorption of f12 = 1. The classical expression for γe derived
from the Lorentz model is [254],
γe =

e2 ω02
.
6π0 me c3

(13.83)

Therefore, in terms of the A21 coefficient and of fundamental constants, the oscillator
strength for absorption is given by,
f12 = A21

2π0 me c3
.
e2 ω02

(13.84)

Oscillator strengths obey certain sum rules that are useful for analyzing the relative
intensities of atomic spectral lines. For example, atoms with single valence electrons
(which are closer to the classical situation) obey the following sum rule,
X

fik = 1 ,

(13.85)

k

where the sum goes over all the excited states reached from the ground state. Alkaline
atoms are approximately one-electron systems, and the oscillator strength of the first
transition S −→ P is typically of the order of f12 = 0.7 − 0.95. The sum rule tells us
that most of the total transition probability for the excitation of the valence electron is
concentrated in the first transition S −→ P , and that transitions to higher states will

13.3. SPECTRAL LINES AND LIFETIMES

417

be comparatively weaker. Another sum rule exists for the excitation and spontaneous
emission from excited intermediate states j:
X
X
fji +
fjk = Z ,
(13.86)
i<j

which is called the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule. In the form of many electrons
[Eq. (13.86)] this rule is very useful, when Z is the number of equivalent electrons,
that is, electrons with the same quantum numbers n, l. Note also, that the numbers
are intrinsically negative. Oscillator strengths are often used in astrophysics and
plasma spectroscopy 9 . They are sometimes tabulated as log gf , where,
g1 f12 = −g2 f21 ≡ gf .

13.3.4

(13.87)

Propagation of light in dielectric media

Let us now use Einstein’s theory to calculate the interaction of light with a gas being
so diluted that we can treat the interaction as occurring with individual atoms. We
first consider the propagation of light through a continuous (non-conducting) dielectric medium. The interaction of light with such a medium allows us to introduce
important quantities, such as the polarization, the susceptibility, the index of refraction, the extinction coefficient, and the absorption coefficient. We shall see later that
the polarization can be considered as densities of dipole moments induced into the
dielectric medium by the oscillating light field. But for the moment, we simply begin
~ with respect to an applied electric field Ẽ~ as,
by defining the polarization P̃
~ = ε χ̃ Ẽ~ .
P̃
0 e

(13.88)

The tilde ∼ ornamenting the quantities means that they are complex, and that measurable quantities must be taken from the real parts. χe is the linear complex electric
susceptibility, which is an intrinsic property of the medium responding to the light
field. It is related to the medium’s dielectric constant,
ε̃ = ε0 (1 + χ̃e ) .

(13.89)

Near resonances, the susceptibility is a strong function of frequency and can be
spatially anisotropic. It is a complex quantity with a real dispersive part, χ0e , and an
imaginary absorptive part, χ00e ,
χ̃e = χ0e + iχ00e .

where η is the refraction index and κ the extinction coefficient of the dielectric medium.

Note, that in a transparent dielectric medium there is no absorption, such that, η 2 =

Propagation of light in dilute gases

We are often interested in the attenuation of the intensity of a beam of light traversing
a dilute gas of resonant scattering atoms. The equation (13.97) describes this attenuation via the properties of the dielectric material. What we are looking for in fact is
a microscopic equivalent description in terms of absorption and light emission rates.
The Einstein rate equation yields the temporal transition rates, but does not say how
they relate to the spatial attenuation length of the light beam. We now consider a
beam propagating through a cell containing an absorptive gas and assume that, along
the optical axis, absorption and emission reach a steady state. We begin with the
Einstein equation (1.65), and write
0 = −N1 B12 u(ω) + N2 B21 u(ω) + N2 A21 .

(13.100)

We now use the result (1.69) to write
N2 A21 = u(ω)B12 (N1 − N2

g1
).
g2

(13.101)

In steady state, the number of the excited atoms is,
N2 =

u(ω)B12 N1
.
A21 + gg12 u(ω)B12

(13.102)

Now, we must treat the refractive index of the dielectric medium carefully. The
expression for the energy density must be modified following Eq. (13.96)
u(ω) =

u(χ) (ω)
.
η2

(13.103)

To use the Einstein coefficients, which suppose propagation at the speed of light in
the vacuum 11 , we must correct the energy density in the dielectric medium before
using it in the equation (13.102) [389]. Therefore, we should express u(ω) in this
equation by u(χ) (ω)/η 2 ,
N2 A21 =

u(χ) (ω)
B12 (N1 − N2 gg12 ) .
η2

(13.104)

Multiplying the two sides with ~ω0 , we see that the left side describes the rate of energy
scattered out of the beam by spontaneous emission, while the right side describes the
energy loss of the beam, i.e., the difference between energy removed by absorption
and energy returned to the beam by stimulated emission,

(13.105)

11 In Einstein’s model, what really matters for inducing transitions is the flux of photons, that is,
the number of photons that traverse an atom per unit of time. This flux can not depend on the
index of refraction. Therefore, we must use the spectral energy density calculated in the vacuum ūω .

420 CHAPTER 13. INTERACTION OF LIGHT WITH MONO-ELECTRONIC ATOMS

13.3.6

Susceptibility and polarization

Everything we have developed so far involves the coupling of a single-mode optical field
with a two-level atom. For this system the Schrödinger equation would be perfectly
adequate. If we want to include spontaneous emission, however, we need the density
matrix formalism. The equations (6.63) do not respect the fact that the excited state
is not only coupled to the incident light field (with the frequency ω), but also with all
modes of the electromagnetic vacuum. To take spontaneous emission into account, we
need to go back to Sec. 1.2.7 and recalculate the absorption coefficient K [Eqs. (13.99),
(1.73)] from the relationship between susceptibility and polarization, Eq. (13.88). In
order to obtain a new expression for the susceptibility, we will write the polarization
in terms of an ensemble of individual transition dipoles. We will use the solutions for
the coefficients of two coupled atomic levels, Eqs. (6.63). However, we will modify the
expression for C2 by adding a term that reflects the spontaneous emission from the
upper state. The resulting expression for the susceptibility (and hence the absorption
coefficient) will reflect the finite ’natural’ life time of the upper state. For the present
discussion we are only concerned with the temporal dependence of the actual light
wave, which we write as,
~ = E~0 cos ωt = 1 [eiωt + e−iωt ] .
E(t)
2

(13.106)

Then we consider how to write the polarization in terms of a susceptibility when the
field contains two conjugate frequencies, ±ω. Substituting into Eq. (13.88), we have,
~
P(t)
= 21 0 E~0 [χ(ω)eiωt + χ(−ω)e−iωt ] .

(13.107)

The polarization can also be expressed in terms of the density of the transition dipoles
in a gas of two-level atoms,

P(t)

the quantum expectation value for the transition dipole moment is,

(13.110)

rj |ψn i and obtain,

hd12 i = −e[a∗1 a2 hr12 ie−ıω0 t + a1 a∗2 hr21 ieıω0 t ] .

(13.111)

Now, we only need to replace the solutions of the coupled equations by relating a1
and a2 of the Eqs. (6.63) in (13.111) which, in turn, can be inserted into the equation

13.3. SPECTRAL LINES AND LIFETIMES

421

(13.107). Thus we obtain an expression for the polarization in terms of properties
of the atoms and the incident field. However, the solution for a2 , Eq. (6.79), does
not consider spontaneous emission. Now, we will introduce an ad hoc modification of
Eq. (6.63) by including a radiative loss constant γ,
da2
.
(13.112)

This term does NOT EXPLAIN spontaneous emission. It simply takes into account
the existence of the effect and characterizes its amplitude through γ: If the incident
field is turned off (Ω∗ = 0)

and
a2 (t) = a2 (0)e−γt .
(13.114)
Ω∗ cos ωteıω0 t a1 − ıγa2 = ı

Now the probability of finding an atom in the excited state (or the fraction of excited
atoms in an ensemble) is,
N2 /N = |a2 (t)|2 = |a2 (0)|2 e−2γt .

(13.115)

Comparing this behavior with the result obtained from the Einstein rate equation,
we see immediately,
A21 = 2γ ≡ Γ .

a1,2 in the transition dipole (13.111) and replacing the average of the orientations,

In most practical situations in the laboratory ω will not be tuned more than some

1015 Hz, it is clear that the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (13.119) will
be negligible compared to the first one. Therefore, we can discard the second term
and write the susceptibility as,

of Γ. The factor of π inserted in the numerator and denominator of the right term of
Eq. (13.121) allows to normalize the profile. We have also assumed in Eq. (13.121)

The Bloch equations
So far we mainly considered low amplitude light fields with broadband emission and
incoherent phases that interact weakly with an atom or a dilute gas. The expression (6.80) allowed us to calculate the probability of finding a two-level atom exposed
to a light field in the excited state. But these expressions were obtained by averaging
over the spectral width of the line, ignoring any phase relationship between the incident field and the excited dipole, and basically assuming a negligible depopulation of
the ground state. For the first half of the 20-th century these assumptions matched
the available light sources, usually incandescent, arc or plasma discharge lamps. After
the invention of the laser in 1958, single mode and pulsed lasers quickly replaced the
lamps as a source for optical excitation. These new light sources initiated a revolution
in optical science, the consequence of which continue to reverberate through modern
sciences and applied technologies.
The characteristics of laser sources are far superior to the old lamps in all respects.
They are intense, collimated, spectrally narrow and phase coherent. The laser gave
rise to a multitude of new spectroscopic techniques and new disciplines, such as quantum electronics, the study of statistical properties of light in quantum optics, optical
cooling and trapping of microscopic particles, the control of chemical reactivity, and
new technologies for imaging and high resolution microscopy.
To tackle the problem from the base we need first to examine what happens
when our two-level atom interacts with light sources, which are spectrally narrow
in comparison to the natural width of optical transitions, and what happens when
the states have a well-defined polarization and phase and the intensities are sufficient
to significantly depopulate the ground state. We will look out for an equation that
describes the temporal evolution of atoms interacting strongly with a single mode of
the radiation field.
A first attempt to solve this problem could be to use the Schrödinger equation,
which describes the temporal evolution of the state of any system. In fact, as long as
we are only interested in stimulated processes, such as the absorption of a monochromatic wave, the Schrödinger equation would suffice. A problem arises when we want
to describe relaxation processes at the same time as excitation processes, after all in
most realistic situations the atom reaches a steady state, where the rate of excitation
and relaxation are equal. Spontaneous emission (and any other dissipative process)
must therefore be included in the physical description of the temporal evolution of our
light-atom system. In this case, however, our system is no longer restricted to a single
mode of the light field and the two atomic states of excitation. Spontaneous emission
populates a statistical distribution of states of the light field and leaves the atom in
425

426

CHAPTER 14. THE BLOCH EQUATIONS

a superposition of many momentum states. This situation can not be described by
a single wavefunction, but only by a distribution of wavefunctions, and we can only
expect to calculate the probability of finding the system within this distribution. The
Schrödinger equation, therefore, no longer applies, and we need to trace the time evolution of a system characterized by a density operator describing a statistical mixture
of quantum states. The equations which describe the time evolution of the matrix
elements of this density operator are the optical Bloch equations, and we must use
them instead of the Schrödinger equation. In order to appreciate the origin and the
physical content of the optical Bloch equations we begin by reviewing the rudiments
of the density matrix theory.

14.1

Density matrix

14.1.1

The density operator

We define the statistical operator or density operator 1 ,
ρ̂ ≡

X

pk P̂k

P̂k ≡ |ψk ihψk | ,

where

k

(14.1)

where {|ψk i} is a complete set of orthonormal states of the system under study. We
have a statistical distribution
P of these states with pk being the probability of finding
|ψk i in the set. Obviously, k pk = 1. That is, the density operator acts on a member
of the set |ψk i such as to extract the probability of finding the system in |ψk i,
X
ρ̂|ψm i =
pk |ψk ihψk |ψm i = pm |ψm i .
(14.2)
k

If all members of the set are in the same state, for example |ψk i, the density operator
reduces to,
ρ̂ = |ψk ihψk | ,
(14.3)
and the system is in a pure state with pk = δkk0 . Each time a quantum state can
be expressed by a single wave function, it is a pure state, but it does not have to be
an eigenstate. Starting from the equation (14.2) we find the diagonal elements of the
density matrix, which are the probabilities of finding the system in |ψm i,
hψm |ρ̂|ψm i = pm .

Assuming that all |ψk i are orthonormal, the non-diagonal elements are necessarily
zero. Besides that,
X
hψk |ρ̂|ψk i = 1 .
(14.5)

So, ρ̂ contains all information about the system. When a state is unknown, ρ̂ describes
the probability of finding the system in each state. When the state is fully known, ρ̂
describes a pure state, that is, a vector in the Hilbert space, which is unequivocally
determined by a complete set of observables with their respective quantum numbers.

(14.6)

Example 58 (Inhomogeneous atomic clouds): For example, a thermal
atomic cloud of N two-level atoms needs in general to be described by a density
operator, because the state of every atom is independent of the state of the
other atoms. If we knew that all atoms behave in the same way, for instance,
when exposed to a radiation field, we could restrict to calculating the evolution
of a single atom and extrapolate to N atoms. However, atomic motion and
interatomic interactions often influence the dynamics.

14.1.1.1

Entropy

In a very general sense, the entropy determines in what direction a reversible process
will take place. It is related to the size of the available phase space on both sides of
the reaction. For example, the coupling of discrete and continuous modes is governed
by entropy considerations.
Entropy measures of the lack of information about a system from which we only
know hĤi,
S ≡ −kB hln ρ̂i = −kB Tr (ρ̂ ln ρ̂) .
(14.7)

The information entropy (or von Neumann entropy) of statistically independent systems ρ̂ ≡ ρ̂1 ⊗ ρ̂2 is additive S = S1 + S2 . We can also define absolute temperatures
by T −1 ≡ ∂S/∂hĤi. The entropy of a pure state is 0. Hamiltonian processes conserve
entropy, for they correspond to non-dissipative unitary transformations. On the other
side, relaxation increases the entropy and the phase space volume. Another common
definition is the so-called purity or Renyi entropy,
SR ≡ h1 − ρ̂i = 1 − Tr (ρ̂2 ) .

(14.8)

Quantum states can exhibit coherences. For example, if we express a state |ψi on
a basis of eigenstates |1i and |2i:


|hψ|1i|2
h1|ψihψ|2i
ρ̂ = |ψihψ| =
.
(14.9)
h2|ψihψ|1i
|hψ|2i|2

428

CHAPTER 14. THE BLOCH EQUATIONS

The evolution of such a state is described by the von Neumann equation,
i~∂t ρ̂(t) = [Ĥ, ρ̂(t)] .

(14.10)

The measurement process is not described by this equation. A pure state will always
remain pure. If the eigenstates do not interact, the density operator will remain
diagonal. The von Neumann equation conserves the properties of hermiticity, ρ̂ = ρ̂† ,
completeness, Tr ρ̂ = 1, and purity det ρ̂ = 0.
The density operator for a statistical mixture in a canonical ensemble (where S is
maximum, U is variable, and N is fixed) follows from a variational problem with the
Lagrange parameters δ(S − kB αh1̂i − kB βhĤi) = 0, since Tr ρ̂ and hĤi are fixed by
boundary conditions. We find,
ρ̂ =

1 −Ĥ/kB T

with

(14.11)

We also have the expectation values, hHi = −∂ ln Z/∂β and (∆H)2 = −∂hĤi/∂β
with the abbreviation β ≡ (kB T )−1 . All quantities are fixed, except the kinetic
energy, which balances the interaction with a heat bath. T is the only equilibrium
parameter. The density operator satisfies a Boltzmann distribution 2 ,

as the projection of the state vector |ψk i on the basis vector |ni. Now, we can write
the density operator matrix representation within the basis {|ni} using the definition
of ρ̂ in Eq. (14.1) and replacing the expansions of |ψk i and hψk | of Eq. (14.13):

Measurement and trace

The sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix representing an operator is called the
trace. This quantity represents a fundamental property of the density operator, since
it is invariant with respect to any unitary transformation:
X
Tr ρ̂ ≡
hn|ρ̂|ni .
(14.19)
n

With the definition of the density operator (14.1) we can write the Eq. (14.19) as,
X
Tr ρ̂ ≡
pk hn|ψk ihψk |ni .

Now, using the completeness relation,

Tr ρ̂ ≡

which shows that the trace of the density operator representation is always 1 regardless
of the basis of the matrix representation.

Now, along the diagonal, we have,

(14.25)

With the closing relation in the basis {|ni}, we now have 3 ,
Tr ρ̂Â =

pk hψk |Â|ψk i = hÂi .

(14.26)

The Eq. (14.26) says that the ensemble average of any dynamic observable Â can be
calculated from the diagonal elements of the operator matrix ρ̂Â: Since the trace is
independent of the basis (this will be shown in Exc. 14.1.5.1), each unitary transformation taking the matrix representation from a basis {|ni} to another one {|ti} leaves
the trace invariant. Using the definition of a unitary transformation we can easily
show that the trace of a cyclic permutation of a product is invariant. For example,
Tr [ÂB̂ Ĉ] = Tr [Ĉ ÂB̂] = Tr [B̂ ÂĈ] ,

(14.27)

Tr [ρ̂Â] = Tr [Âρ̂] = hÂi .

(14.28)

and in particular
In the Excs. 14.1.5.2 and 14.1.5.3 we apply the density operator to pure and mixed
states of a two-level system. In Exc. 14.1.5.4 we study thermal mixtures and Exc. 15.1.4.2
Glauber states.
14.1.2.2

Measurement process

P
P
If an observable Â has a spectral representation Â = n an |an ihan | = n an Pn , with
P̂n = |an ihan |, the measurement process will transform the density operator to,
ρ̂0 =

X

P̂n ρ̂Pn .

(14.29)

n

That is, after the measurement, the operator becomes diagonal on the basis of the
eigenvalues of Â 4 , as explained in Sec. 2.2.7. The expression can be thought of as
the mathematical formulation of von Neumann’s state reduction postulate.
3 In the presence of degeneracy or a continuous part of the spectrum we can generalize the definition
of the expectation,
X
hX̂i ≡ Tr ρ̂X̂ =
hkm|ρ̂X̂|kmi .
k,m

4A

projective measure always increases entropy. The entropy of a pure state is zero, while that
of a mixture is always greater than zero. Therefore, a pure state can be converted into a mixture
by a measurement, but the reverse can not happen. Thus, the action of measuring induces an
irreversible change in the density matrix reminiscent of the collapse of the wavefunction. Strangely,
the measurement reduces the amount of information by quenching the quantum interference of the
compound system in a process called quantum decoherence. A subsystem can be taken from a mixed
state to a pure state only at the price of increasing the von Neumann entropy elsewhere in the global
system.

14.1. DENSITY MATRIX

431

We note that the density operator (14.29) describes the whole ensemble after
the measurement. The sub-ensemble corresponding to a particular result an of the
measurement is described by a different density operator,
ρ̂0n =

P̂n ρ̂P̂n
Tr [ρ̂P̂n ]

.

(14.30)

This is true, when |an i is the only eigenvector with the eigenvalue an . If not, P̂n in the
expression (14.30) should be replaced by the projection operator onto the sub-space of
an 5 . In Exc. 15.1.4.3 we study the projection of Glauber states and in Exc. 14.1.5.7
of entangled states.
14.1.2.3

Systems and subsystems

Density operators are very useful for playing with systems and subsystems. Let us, for
instance, assume that we have two quantum systems defined on the Hilbert spaces H1
and H2 . The composite system is then the tensor product H1 ⊗ H2 . We now suppose
that the compound system is in a pure state, |ψi ∈ H1 ⊗ H2 . If the state can be
written in the form |ψi = |ψ1 i ⊗ |ψ2 i, this means that the state of the first subsystem
is |ψ1 i. However, in general, |ψi does not decompose like this. Of course, every vector
in H1 ⊗ H2 is a linear combination of tensorial products of H1 and H2 . If |ψi can not
be decomposed as a tensor product, we say that the two systems are entangled. In
this case, there is no reasonable way of associating a pure state |ψ1 i ∈ H1 to the state
ψ ∈ H1 ⊗ H2 . If, for example, in the case of a two particle wavefunction Ψ(x1 , x2 )
there is no way to construct a wavefunction (i.e. a pure state) ψ1 (x1 ) describing the
state of the first particle, then Ψ(x1 , x2 ) 6= ψ1 (x1 )ψ2 (x2 ).
The point of the discussion is that, even if the total system is in a pure state, the
various subsystems that compose it will normally be in mixed states. On the other
hand, regardless of whether the composite system is in a pure or mixed state, we can
perfectly construct a density matrix that describes the state. Therefore, the use of
density matrices is inevitable. Let ρ̂ be the density matrix of the system composed
of two subsystems. Then the state in H2 is described by a reduced density operator
given by the partial trace of ρ̂ over H2 . In the particular case, where the state the
density matrix has the form ρ̂ = ρ̂1 ⊗ ρ̂2 , where ρ̂1 and ρ̂2 are the density matrices in
H1 and H2 , then the partial trace is simply, Tr H2 ρ̂ρ̂1 .

14.1.3

Temporal evolution of the density operator

As shown in Secs. 2.4.2 to 2.4.4, the equations governing the temporal evolution of
a quantum system depend on the choice of the picture, i.e. Schrödinger’s (2.127),
Heisenberg’s (2.133), or the interaction picture (2.140). This, of course, also applies
to a system represented by a density matrix.
5 In general, assuming that f is a function associating each observable Â with a number f (Â)
(which we may imagine as the expectation value), we can state the following: If f satisfies some
natural properties (such as the one to produce positive values for positive operators), then there
exists a unique density matrix ρ̂, such that f (Â) = Tr (ρ̂Â) for all Â. That is, every reasonable
’family’ of expectation values’ can be represented by a density matrix, which suggests that the
density matrix provides the most general description of a quantum state.

432

CHAPTER 14. THE BLOCH EQUATIONS

Returning to the density operator definition (14.1), we can express its temporal
dependence in terms of time-dependent quantum states and of the time evolution
operator (2.130),
X
X
ρ̂(t) =
pk |ψk (t)ihψk (t)| =
pk U (t, t0 )|ψk (t0 )ihψk (t0 )|U † (t, t0 ) .
(14.31)
k

k

Writing,
ρ̂(t0 ) =

X
k

we see immediately,

pk |ψk (t0 )ihψk (t0 )| ,

ρ̂(t) = U (t, t0 )ρ̂(t0 )U † (t, t0 ) ,

(14.32)

(14.33)

where, for the common case of a time-independent Hamiltonian,
U (t, t0 ) = e−ıĤ(t−t0 )/~ .

(14.34)

Now we find the time derivative of the density operator differentiating the two sides
of (14.33) and substituting the Eqs.
1
dU
= ĤU
dt
ı~

and

dU †
1
= − U † Ĥ
dt
ı~

(14.35)

for the time derivatives U and U † . The result is
dρ̂(t)
ı
= [ρ̂(t), Ĥ] .
dt
~

(14.36)

The commutator itself can be considered as a superoperator acting, not any more on
states but on operators, that is, we can write,
Lρ̂(t) ≡

ı
[ρ̂(t), Ĥ] ,
~

(14.37)

where L is called Liouville operator. The equation (14.36) is called Liouville equation
or von Neumann equation. The Liouville equation describes the time evolution of the
density operator which, in turn, describes the distribution of an ensemble of quantum
states. Even though the form of the Liouville equation resembles the Heisenberg
equation, Eq. (14.31) shows that ρ̂(t) is in the Schrödinger picture.
For a two-level system perturbatively interacting with a light field, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed as in (2.137) into a stationary part and a time-dependent
part,
Ĥ = Ĥatom + V̂ (t) ,
(14.38)
where Ĥa is the part of the Hamiltonian describing the atomic structure and V̂ (t)
the interaction of the dipole transition with the classical oscillating electric field. The
interaction picture is the natural choice for this type of problem. In this case, we can
transform the density operator into the interaction picture defined by (2.138),
ρ̃(t) = eıĤatom (t−t0 )/~ ρ̂(t0 )e−ıĤatom (t−t0 )/~ ,

(14.39)

14.1. DENSITY MATRIX

433

where the ’tilde’ decoration (replacing the ’hat’) emphasizes, that we are now in the
interaction picture. We look for the time evolution rate of ρ̃(t) analogously to the
Liouville equation. Calculating the time derivatives on both sides of (14.39) and
substituting Eq. (14.36) for ddtρ̂ results in,
dρ̃(t)
ı
= [ρ̃(t), V̂ (t)] .
dt
~

(14.40)

This equation shows that the time evolution of the density operator in the interaction
picture depends only on the time-dependent part of the total Hamiltonian.

14.2

Bloch equations for two-level atoms

In this section we will begin to apply the ideas and tools developed in the previous
sections. Let us first make use of the density matrix to describe a two-level atom
coupled to a single-mode light field without spontaneous emission. We will then
introduce the atomic Bloch vector as a convenient and suggestive method to describe
the time evolution of a coupled two-level atom.
The internal structure of atoms is analyzed in atomic physics, where we find that
the energy levels are discrete (Bohr’s axiom). The center of mass motion of the atoms
and collisions with other atoms are ignored, and concerning the interaction of the
atoms with light, we are only interested in the aspect, that the interaction can induce
transitions between internal states via absorption or emission of photons. It is the
duty of atomic physics to calculate the frequencies and strengths of transitions (by
Hartree-Fock or similar methods), as well as their behavior in external electric and
magnetic fields. The results of these calculations are visualized in energy level schemes
called Grotrian diagrams. In quantum optics we do not care, how the energies of the
levels were calculated, but accept them as given. That is, we assume the Hamiltonian
of the unperturbed atom to be diagonalized, so that its internal structure can be
written as,
X
Ĥatom =
~ωj |jihj| .
(14.52)
j

14.2.1

The matrix elements of the density operator

Since the optical Bloch equations are coupled differential equations relating the elements of the density operator matrix, we must examine the temporal dependence
of these matrix elements, based on our knowledge of the operator’s properties. This
can be done in the Schrödinger picture using Eq. (14.36), in the interaction picture
using Eq. (14.40), or directly in the co-rotating frame using Eq. (14.49). For didactic
reason we will begin with the Schrödinger picture and derive the other representation
once again.
So, let us begin with Liouville equation (14.36) and evaluate the elements of the
matrix,
hm|

dρ̂(t)
|ni = ~ı hm|[ρ̂(t), Ĥ]|ni = ~ı hm|[ρ̂(t), Ĥatom + V̂ (t)]|ni
dt
= ~ı (En − Em )hm|ρ̂(t)|ni + ~ı hm|[ρ̂(t), V̂ (t)]|ni ,

(14.53)

where |mi and |ni are members of a complete set of vectors of a basis {|ki} which are
also eigen-kets of ĤA and span the space of Ĥ. Now, we insert the closing expression

14.2. BLOCH EQUATIONS FOR TWO-LEVEL ATOMS

|kihk| in the commutator on the right-hand side of Eq. (14.53):
X
hm|[ρ̂(t), V̂ (t)]|ni =
[hm|ρ̂(t)|kihk|V̂ |ni − hm|V̂ |kihk|ρ̂(t)|ni] .

(14.54)

k

For our two-level atom the complete set only includes two states: |1(t)i = |1i and
|2(t)i = e−ıω0 t |2i. In addition, the matrix elements of the dipole coupling operator V̂
are only non-diagonal,
V ≡ h1|V̂ |2i = h2|V̂ |1i .
(14.55)
Hence, Eq. (14.53) adopts the form,
dρ̂11

dρ̂22

dρ̂∗12

remembering that the dash of the diagonal terms, called populations, must be unitary,
and that the non-diagonal terms, called coherences, must be complex,
ρ̂11 + ρ̂22 = 1

,

ρ̂12 = ρ̂∗12 .

(14.57)

The above set of equations constitutes the optical Bloch equations in the Schrödinger
picture. It does not include loss terms due to spontaneous emission. We transform the
Bloch equations to the interaction picture by replacing the Liouville equation (14.36)
by (14.40), and calculating the matrix elements. We obtain,
dρ̃22
ı
= V (ρ̃21 − ρ̃12 )
dt
~

and

dρ̃12
ı
= V (ρ̃11 − ρ̃22 ) .
dt
~

(14.58)

We would also have obtained this expression via the substitution, ρ̂12 = ρ̃12 eiω0 t .
The interaction picture simplifies the expressions for the temporal dependence of the
coherences by eliminating the first term on the right-hand side. Transforming to the
interaction picture removes the temporal dependence of the basis vectors spanning
the Hilbert space of the two-level atom.
We have derived the optical Bloch equations from the Liouville equation, which is
the fundamental equation of motion of the density operator, and we have seen how a
unitary transformation can be used to represent these equations in the Schrödinger,
Heisenberg or interaction picture. So far, the Bloch equations do not include the possibility of spontaneous emission. We will learn later, how to include this phenomenon.

14.2.2

Rotating wave approximation

In the following, we will only consider exponentials rotating with the frequency ∆ ≡
ω −ω0 , and we will neglect terms rotating like ∆ ≡ ω +ω0 . This approximation, called

438

CHAPTER 14. THE BLOCH EQUATIONS

rotating wave approximation (RWA) is good, when the Rabi frequency is sufficiently
small, Ω  ω. Otherwise, we observe an energy correction of the levels called BlochSiegert shift. The RWA can be implemented in the time dependence of the coupling
operator,
V (t) = ~Ω cos ωt → ~2 Ωe−ıωt ,
(14.59)
neglecting the part 21 ~Ωeıωt .
Once the RWA made, we can transform to the rotating system by the prescription,
ρ12 ≡ ρ̂12 e−ıωt

ρ22 ≡ ρ̂22 ,

(14.60)

Pauli matrices and the atomic Bloch vector

Let us come back to the unperturbed atomic Hamiltonian (14.52). The electronic
states are orthonormal hi|ji = δij , and we define the transition operators by
σ̂ij |ki = δjk |ii ,

(14.71)

and σ̂ij
= σ̂ji satisfying the commutation relation,

[σ̂ij , σ̂lk ] = δjl σ̂ik − δik σ̂lj .

(14.72)

Many times we will restrict ourselves to atoms of two or three levels. For a two-level
system we obtain the Pauli spin matrix defined in (2.45). Every 2 × 2 matrix can be

as will be shown in Exc. 14.2.6.4. ρ12 describes the polarization and ρ22 − ρ11 the

for a rigid rotor or spinning top (for example, a dipole in a homogeneous field).
It displays phenomena such as precession and nutation. The physical content and
usefulness of the Bloch vector will become clearer when we use the formalism to
analyze electric and magnetic couplings. In Exc. 14.2.6.5 we verify that the Bloch
vector is normalized (as long as spontaneous emission is not considered).

State manipulations by sequences of radiation pulses

The temporal dependence of the three components of the atomic Bloch vector provides
a useful illustration of the atom-field interaction. Resonant coupling, ∆ = 0 and
G = Ω, puts the solutions (14.69) into the form,
ρ22 (t) = 12 (1 − cos Ωt)
that is,

(14.80)

(14.81)

That is, a resonant pulse rotates a Bloch vector initially pointing in the direction
π
−z within the plane z-y, until it arrives, at time t = 2Ω
, at the +y direction and
π
at time t = Ω at the +z direction. This means that the entire population has been
transferred to the excited state. The Bloch vector continues to rotate (the movement
is called nutation) around the torque vector G which, as can be seen from Eq. (14.76),
points at the +x direction when ∆ = 0. The nutation frequency is proportional to the
force Ω of the atom-field interaction. With the Eq. (14.69) we see that the population
oscillates between the ground and excited state with the frequency Ω. This means
that the energy ~ω is periodically exchanged between the atom and the field. A pulse
of resonant light of duration such that τ = π/2Ω is called a π/2-pulse. The nutation
is illustrated in Fig. 14.1(a).
Once the coherence has been excited by a detuned radiation, ∆ 6= 0, the Bloch
vector does not stand still, even after the radiation has been switched off. To see this,
we consider again the general solution (14.65) now entering Ω = 0. If the Bloch vector
is initially at a point in the unitary circle of the plane z-y, it will rotate according to
the formula,
ρ22 (t) = ρ22 (0)
,
ρ12 (t) = ρ12 (0)e−ı∆t ,
(14.82)
that is,





~(t) = ρ12 (0) cos ∆t .
2ρ22 (0) − 1

(14.83)

That is, the Bloch vector performs a motion of precession around the symmetry axis.
The precession is illustrated in Fig. 14.1(b).
The evolution of the Bloch vector on the surface of the Bloch sphere under the influence of radiation fields can be considered a coherent trajectory of the wavefunction
of the atomic state, which is therefore subject to interference phenomena [308]. Interferometers can be realized by sequences of consecutive pulses splitting populations,
exciting coherences, and remixing populations.
Sensors based on interferometry of atomic excitation are nowadays among the most
accurate and most sensitive. We will discuss the method of radiation pulse sequences
in several exercises: In the Excs. 14.2.6.6, 14.2.6.7, and 14.2.6.8 the Ramsey method.

synchronously to incident radiation. The concentration of a sufficient number of
atoms in a small volume can, however, introduce additional (desirable or undesirable)
effects. Collisions, for instance, induce (irreversible) decoherence. On the other hand,
if the ensemble is sufficiently dense that the mean distance between atoms is less than
a resonant wavelength, then the transition dipoles of the individual atoms will couple
to produce a collective dipole moment and generate effects known as superradiance.
Thermal motion of the atoms is another undesired effect, because every atom will
interact with the radiation on a different Doppler-shifted frequency. This leads to
diffusion of the individual atomic Bloch vectors in the x-y-plane, which in turn limits
the resolution of interferometric applications. We will discuss in Exc. 14.2.6.9 the
photon echo method, which allows to circumvent this problem.

14.2.5

Nuclear magnetic resonance

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a
strong constant magnetic field (up to 20 T) are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field (in the near field) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with
a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus. This process occurs
near resonance, when the oscillation frequency (typically 60..1000 MHz) matches the
intrinsic frequency of the nuclei, which depends on the strength of the static magnetic
field, the chemical environment, and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved.
NMR spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in
solution and in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The most commonly used nuclei are 1 H and 13 C.
NMR transitions can be excited, when the electron spins do not participate in the
interaction, e.g. because they are paired (see Eq. (9.41)), and when the nucleus has
an intrinsic nuclear magnetic moment µ
~ˆI and hence an angular momentum Î. This is
the case for an odd number of protons and/or neutrons. Nuclides with even numbers
of both have a total spin of zero and are therefore NMR-inactive.
The principle of NMR usually involves three sequential steps: (i) The alignment
~0 . (ii) The
of the magnetic nuclear spins in an applied, constant magnetic field B

14.2. BLOCH EQUATIONS FOR TWO-LEVEL ATOMS

~1 (t) called rf-pulse. (iii) The detection of the NMR signal during or after
field B
the rf-pulse via the voltage induced in a detection coil due to the precession of the
~0 . After an rf-pulse, the nuclear dipole moment precesses at
nuclear spins around B
the nuclei’s intrinsic Larmor frequency without involving transitions between spin
states. Choosing the two magnetic fields perpendicular to each other, one maximizes
the NMR signal strength,
~ = Brf (t)êx + B0 êz ,
B(t)

(14.84)

where, because of |Brf (t)|  B0 , we choose the z-axis as the quantization axis and
the rf-field as a perturbation along the x-axis.
The energy of a nuclear magnetic dipole moment placed in a magnetic field is
[177],

where γI is the gyromagnetic ratio of the specific nucleus and Î the nuclear spin

(14.93)

which corroborates the result (14.87). Apparently, the nuclear magnetic dipole moment (and hence the spin magnetization) precesses around the magnetic field with
the Larmor frequency leaving the populations of the energy levels unaffected.
A perturbation of nuclear spin orientations from equilibrium will occur when an
oscillating magnetic field is applied whose frequency ωrf sufficiently closely matches
the Larmor precession frequency ωL . The populations of the spin-up and -down
energy levels then undergo Rabi oscillations. The stronger the oscillating field, the
faster the Rabi oscillations or the precession around the effective field in the rotating
frame. After a certain time (typically on the order of 2..1000 µs), a resonant rf-π/2pulse flips the spin magnetization to the transverse plane, while after a twice longer
time, the initial magnetization is inverted (π-pulse). It is the transverse magnetization
generated by a resonant oscillating field which is usually detected in NMR.
The most important perturbation of the NMR frequency for applications of NMR
is the ’shielding’ effect of the surrounding shells of electrons. Electrons, similar to
the nucleus, are also charged and rotate with a spin to produce a magnetic field
opposite to the applied magnetic field. In general, this electronic shielding reduces
the magnetic field at the nucleus. The corresponding shift in the NMR frequency due
to the electronic molecular orbital coupling to the external magnetic field is called
chemical shift, and it explains why NMR is able to probe the chemical structure of
molecules, which depends on the electron density distribution in the corresponding
molecular orbitals.
After perturbation the nuclear spins return to thermodynamic equilibrium due to
relaxation processes. These are phenomenological included in the Bloch equations via
decay time constants Ti ,

(14.94)

T1 = Γ−1 is the time constant for ’longitudinal magnetic’ relaxation and refers to
the mean time for an individual nucleus to return to its thermal equilibrium state of
the spins. The precessing nuclei can also fall out of alignment with each other and
gradually stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation, where
T2 = 2γ −1 . Because of the difference in the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for
example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions),
T1 is usually longer than T2 , which, in practice, also depends on significant static
magnetic field inhomogeneities.

characterized by the Rabi frequency Ω12 , and we will compare two cases: without
and with spontaneous emission:
a. Write down the Hamiltonian of the system, propose a sequence of pulses allowing
the observation of the Ramsey fringes, do a numerical simulation of the Schrödinger
equation (based on the prescription (14.172)), and prepare a graph of the type

b. Calculate numerically from the Schrödinger equation the population ρ22 immediately after the pulse sequence as a function of the detuning ∆12 of the radiation field,

446

and prepare a graph of the spectrum. Also, assuming a decay rate of Γ12 = 0.1Ω12 ,
calculate the population ρ22 as a function of detuning ∆12 from the Bloch equations
(making sequences of type (14.172)), prepare a new graph, and compare it with the
previous graph obtained by the Schrödinger equation.
c. What happens to the width of the fringes, when the free precession time τ between
the Ramsey pulses is increased? Prepare a graph of the inversion 2ρ22 −1 as a function

14.2.6.9

Ex: Photon echo

’Photon echo’ is a powerful spectroscopic technique that allows circumvention of certain dephasing processes, for example, the Doppler shift due to the atomic motion in
a thermal sample of atoms. The technique resembles the Ramsey method with the
difference, that between the two Ramsey π/2-pulses, that is, during the free precession time, we apply an additional π-pulse, which inverts the imaginary part of the
coherence. We will study this method by numerical simulation of the Schrödinger
equation and the Bloch equations for a two-level system with and without spontaneous emission:
a. Write down the Hamiltonian of the system and do a numerical simulation of the
Schrödinger equation (concatenating the pulses as explained in Eq. (14.172)) for the
following temporal pulse sequence:
(i) resonant π/2-pulse (∆12 = 0) choosing Ω12 = 2,
(ii) evolution for a time T without radiation (Ω12 = 0),
(ii) resonant π/2-pulse using the same parameters as in (i),
(iv) evolution for a time T without radiation, and
(v) resonant π/2-pulse identical to the first pulse.
Prepare a graph of type Fig. 14.1 illustrating the temporal evolution of the Bloch
vector during the sequence. Now, repeat the sequence taking into account a possible
Doppler shift leading to ∆12 6= 0.
b. Repeat the calculation of (a), now numerically solving the Bloch equations, which
allow the occurrence of spontaneous emission (Γ12 = 0.03Ω12 ). Interpret the results.

In this section we will introduce spontaneous emission and the important concepts
of polarization and susceptibility emanating from an excited sample of oscillating
dipoles. Optical Bloch equations including spontaneous emission will be given and
their stationary solutions will be discussed. Dissipative processes always broaden
transition lines, and thus we will discuss various broadening mechanisms.

Susceptibility and nonlinear optics

The frequency-dependent linear susceptibility completely describes the linear propagation of an electromagnetic wave within a medium. It is related to the index of
refraction and the absorption coefficient. Nonlinear processes should be described by
higher order susceptibilities. Electric fields E~ = E~0 eıωt + c.c. induce in media charac~ = χE.

Nonlinearity of the Bloch equations

Because the Bloch equation go beyond perturbation theory they contain nonlinear
optics. We can see this by the simple fact that strong radiation field can saturate
atomic transitions. For example, expanding the population and coherence (14.99) by

Liouville equation for two levels

In this chapter we chose to include spontaneous emission in the Bloch equations
by phenomenological arguments. We will show more ahead, that dissipation can
be treated from general principles. This treatment, named after Weisskopf-Wigner,
derives from a Liouville type equation (14.36), but which holds for a total density
operator ρatom&f ield describing the atom and the electromagnetic modes, an equation
for the density operator of only the atom. The price to pay for this simplification is
an additional term appearing in the equation now called master equation,

The real parts of the eigenvalues Re E describe shifts and/or splittings of the transition line. The imaginary parts Im E describe broadening effects of the lines.
In the simplest case, ∆ = 0 and Γ > 4Ω, we find the saturation broadening already
discussed in (14.100), and we will deepen it in Exc. 14.3.5.11. For the case Γ < 4Ω,
we observe a splitting of the line called Autler-Townes splitting, which will be studied
in Exc. 14.3.5.12. If Ω 6= 0, the spectrum becomes asymmetrical. In the case of
weak excitation, Γ  4Ω, we observe a shift of the transition line with dispersive
dependence (near the resonance) on the frequency of the incident radiation. This is
the dynamic Stark shift (or light-shift). In the case of strong excitation, Γ  4Ω, we
observe again at the split spectrum, but now the two lines exhibit an avoided crossingtype dependence on the radiation frequency. We study these effects in Exc. 14.3.5.14.
Obviously, these effects can be studied by the Bloch equation formalism containing
the terms of spontaneous relaxation.

’meter transition’ to infer the evolution of the ’system transition’).

Ex: Saturation broadening and Autler-Townes splitting

14.4

Line broadening mechanisms

The resolution of atomic spectroscopy is generally limited by several perturbative
effects, many of them originating in the atomic motion. They manifest themselves as
broadening and/or shifts of atomic resonances. Free atoms, as well as atoms confined
in potentials, have kinetic energy and evolve on extended phase space trajectories.
If the spatial localization is less than the effective cross section of the exciting laser
beam, then the interaction time is limited and the resonance lines are broadened by
the Fourier effect in a process called transit time broadening, and the efficiency of
fluorescence collection is reduced. The same happens with the Doppler effect: Only
those atoms that have a specific velocity along the optical axis defined by the laser
beam can interact. Free as well as confined atoms can only scatter when they are in
specific cells of the phase space.
There are two different fundamental types of broadening. The so-called homogeneous broadening affects all atoms in the same way regardless of their positions or
velocities. It usually give rise to Lorentzian line profiles and can be included in the
Bloch equations. It correspond to an acceleration of the relaxation. Examples are the
natural linewidth, saturation broadening, and collision broadening.
The so-called inhomogeneous broadening is due to a displacement of atomic levels, which may be different for each atom. Averaging over a large sample of atoms,
the displacements generate an effective broadening usually with a Gaussian line profile. It can not be included in the Bloch equations, but only as an average over all
trajectories of all atoms. It does not correspond to an accelerated relaxation. Inhomogeneous broadening is often due to external perturbations, e.g., Doppler broadening
and broadening due to temporal fluctuations or spatial inhomogeneities of external
electric or magnetic fields. In Exc. 14.4.6.1 we calculate the optical density of atomic
clouds. In Exc. 14.4.6.2 we present a spectroscopic technique bypassing the Doppler
broadening called Doppler-free spectroscopy and calculate the Lamb-dip profile. Finally, in Exc. 14.4.6.3, we discuss a cooling technique allowing for the reduction of
Doppler broadening, called Zeeman slower.

14.4.1

Saturation broadening

Eq. (14.100) shows that when the power of the incident light increases, the population
of the excited state saturates at a limit value of ρ22 = 21 . The saturation parameter
defined in (14.101) measures the degree of saturation. When the narrowband light
source is tuned to resonance, the saturation parameter is basically a measure for the

14.4. LINE BROADENING MECHANISMS

455

ratio between the stimulated population transfer rate Ω and the spontaneous decay
rate A21 . We can rewrite the stationary population of the excited level as in (14.102).
In resonance and with the saturation parameter s = 1, we obtain
Ω=

√1 Γ

(14.117)

We can use equation (14.117) to define the saturation intensity Isat for an atom with
the transition dipole d12 . From Eq. (1.41) we have,

E0 =

(14.118)

Therefore, using the definition of the Rabi frequency, ~Ω = d12 E0 , and the relationship

(14.119)

taking into account the degeneracies gj of the levels. In Exc. 14.4.6.4 we calculate the
saturation intensity of popular atomic transitions.

14.4.2

Collision broadening

The theory of atomic collisions covers a large area of research, including elastic and
inelastic, reactive and ionizing processes. In low-pressure gases at room temperature
or hotter we need only consider the simpler processes: long-range van der Waals
interactions that result in elastic collisions. The ’low pressure’ criterion requires that
the average free path between collisions be greater than any linear dimension of the gas
volume. Under these conditions, collisions can be modeled with straight trajectories,
along which the interaction time is short and the time between collisions is long in
comparison with the radiative lifetime of the excited atomic state. Then, the impact
of a collision on the emission of a radiating atom causes a loss of coherence due to a
phase interruption of the excited state atomic wavefunction. The term ’elastic’ means
that the collision does not disturb the populations of the internal states, so we only
need to consider the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix,
dρ12
Ω0
= ı eı(ω−ω0 )t (ρ11 − ρ22 ) − γ 0 ρ12 ,
dt
2

(14.120)

where γ 0 is the sum of the spontaneous emission γ and the collision rate γcol ,
γ 0 = γ + γcol .

(14.121)

The inverse of the collision rate is simply the time between phase interruptions or the
time between collisions. Now, for collisions between hard cores of atoms of mass m
(with reduced mass mred = m/2) and with radius ρ in a gas with density n consisting

authors define the saturation for s = 2, as happens when Ω = Γ.

We can now relate this simple result of gas kinetics to the phase interruption

propagating through space suffers a collision, the long-range interaction will produce
a time-dependent perturbation of the energy levels of the radiating atom and a phase
shift in the radiation,

When the excitation is sufficiently weak, so that power broadening can be neglected

(14.132)

The equations (14.100) and (14.132) express the linewidths in the limits of dominating
power and collision broadening, respectively. Note that the susceptibility, absorption
coefficient, and absorption cross-section retain their Lorentzian profile, but with a
larger width due to collisions. Since each atom is subject to the same broadening
mechanism, the broadening is homogeneous. Solve Excs. 14.4.6.5.

14.4.3

Doppler broadening

The Doppler broadening is simply the apparent frequency distribution of a sample of
radiating atoms at temperature T . The contribution of each atom to the radiation
appears detuned by the Doppler shift because of its velocity. The frequency shift for
a non-relativistically moving particle is ω = ω0 /(1 − vc ), such that,

CHAPTER 14. THE BLOCH EQUATIONS

The profile compares with the Lorentzian profile Eq. (1.74) associated with natural,
power, or collision broadening. Doppler broadening is a property of the atomic ensemble, each atom suffering a unique but different displacement than the other atoms.
Hence, it is called inhomogeneous broadening.
The Liouville equation (14.51) used to derive the Bloch equations assumes immobile atoms. However, we can easily apply the Galilei transformation to a system,
where the atoms move with the given velocity v,
(∂t + v · ∇)ρ̂(r, t) = − ~ı [Ĥ, ρ̂(r, t)] .

(14.138)

Since the light fields propagate as eı(ωt−k·r) , the solution of the above equation simply
follows from the immobile solution with the substitution ∆ → ∆ − k · v. For a cloud

The average of the density operator over all velocities, ρ̄, therefore follows as the
convolution of the density operator ρ (obtained as the solution of the Bloch equation)

and the Gaussian function G(∆) = (2πδ 2 )−1/2 e−∆ /2δ ,
ρ̄(∆) = (G ? ρ̂)(∆) .

Voigt profile

It is clear that in many practical circumstances homogeneous and inhomogeneous
processes simultaneously contribute to the broadening of lines. In these cases, we
can consider that the radiation of each atom, homogeneously broadened by phaseinterruption processes (such as spontaneous emission or collisions), is displaced by
the Doppler effect within the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the
temperature T . The profile of the gaseous sample, therefore, is a convolution of
homogeneous and inhomogeneous profiles. The resulting profile is called Voigt profile:

14.4.5

Bloch equations with phase modulation

In some situations, the atom vibrates thus producing an oscillating Doppler shift.
Also, external magnetic fields or oscillating laser frequencies can produce this effect.
We incorporate this temporal modulation (frequency Ωa ) of the light frequency shifts,

14.4. LINE BROADENING MECHANISMS

induced by the Doppler effect, into the optical Bloch equations via the substitution
[559],
∆ij → ∆ij + kij · v cos Ωa t .
(14.142)
The Bloch equations can then be brought into the form,
ρ̂˙ = (L + 2X cos Ωa t)ρ̂ + b ,

(14.143)

where the matrix X contains the modulation index of the atomic motion kij v. The
stationary solution of the differential equation, averaged over the time of an oscillation
period, can be expressed as an infinite continuous fraction:

14.4.6.2

Ex: Saturated absorption spectroscopy

Saturated absorption spectroscopy is a technique to avoid Doppler broadening. The
setup, shown in Fig. 14.4, consists of a cell filled with a rubidium gas (resonance
frequency ω0 = ck = 2πc/780 nm, decay rate Γ = (2π) 6 MHz) and two laser beams
with the same frequency ω but counterpropagating, one called saturation and another
called probe. The one-dimensional and normalized Maxwell velocity distribution is,
r
2
m
ρ(v)dv =
e−mv /2kB T dv .
2πkB T
The gas is at T = 300 K, where the partial pressure of rubidium is around P =
10−1 mbar. The length of the cell is L = 10 cm. The probe laser has an intensity
below the saturation limit, such that the cross section of an atom moving at velocity
v is,
Γ2
6π
.
σ(v) = 2
k 4(ω − ω0 − kv)2 + Γ2
The saturation laser has high intensity. We suppose here, Ω ≡ 10Γ, where Ω is the
frequency of Rabi caused by the saturation beam. In this way it creates a population
Ne of atoms in the excited state. As this population lacks in the ground state,

14.4.6.3

Ex: The Zeeman slower

Consider a tube through which passes a collimated beam of atoms, all having the
same initial velocity v = v0 . In the opposite direction to the atomic motion travels
a collimated and monochromatic light beam with frequency ω = kc. The absorption
rate for photons by an atom has a Lorentzian profile, which can be written as:
W (v) =

W0
Γ2
,
2π (ω − ω0 + kv)2 + (Γ/2)2

where Γ is the natural width of the spectral line at ω0 , and W0 is a constant. The
frequency of the light is tuned in order to compensate for the Doppler effect at the
beginning of the tube, δ = ω − ω0 = −kv0 (the light is tuned to the red of the
resonance). As the atoms are decelerated, they cease to be resonant with the light
beam and fail to absorb photons. This can be avoided by employing the so-called
Zeeman-slowing technique, which compensates for the effect using the Zeeman-shift
induced by magnetic fields. In this exercise, we will study what happens if this
technique is not used.
a. For an atom with velocity v, write an expression for the mean travel distance

Ex: Rate equations as a limiting case of Bloch equations

We show in this exercise that, in the limit Γ  Ω, we can derive, from the Bloch
equations, the Einstein rate equations. Proceed as follows:
a. Apply the condition ρ̇12 = 0 to the Bloch equations for a two-level system (14.99),
determine ρ12 (∞), and replace this stationary value in the equations for the populations ρkk (t) using, as an abbreviation, the transition rate R ≡ γs, where s is the
saturation parameter (14.101).
b. Integrate the rate equations over the entire spectrum, i.e. ∆ ∈ [−∞, ∞], and derive
Einstein’s equations using the relations (13.7), (13.38), and (13.39).

Multi-level systems

The two-level system represents an idealization of the real atom, since at least one of
the levels is usually degenerate. Many important phenomena in quantum optics are
not found in this system, but conditioned to the existence of a third level. Examples
are optical pumping (essential for laser operation), quantum jumps or dark resonances

14.5. MULTI-LEVEL SYSTEMS

[which are at the basis of the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT)].
To derive the Bloch equations for atoms with several levels excited by several
lasers and coupled to free space (i.e. without external cavity), we can use the same
master equation (14.114), but with a generalized Hamiltonian in the semiclassical
approximation 8 and a Lindbladt operator,

laser linewidths. The levels have the energy ~ωi above the ground level. The Rabi
frequency Ωij is a measure for the force at which the levels |ii and |ji are coupled
by the resonantly irradiated light field. The master equation can be simplified by
applying the rotating wave approximation and transforming to the coordinate system
which rotates with the light frequencies ωij :

Finally, the master equation can be reformulated by introducing a generalized

Alternatively to the complex formulation, the differential equations can be written
for the real and imaginary part of the Bloch vector. The components ρii correspond
to the population probabilities of the levels |ii, the non-diagonal elements ρij describe
the coherences between |ii and |ji. Now, we must insert the Hamiltonian (14.149)
and the density operator ρij into the Liouville equation (14.36) in order to derive
the generalized Bloch equations. In practice, these calculations are simple but heavy.
Therefore, we describe in Sec. 14.5.4 a simplified recipe for compiling Bloch equations
for arbitrary level systems for real atoms.

dark resonances treated in Exc. 14.5.5.8, and the quantum jumps, which will be studied
in later chapters. In Excs. 14.5.5.9 and 14.5.5.10 we will show, that an atomic gas
may have negative permittivity and negative permeability and, consequently, properties
usually only found in artificial metamaterials, as for example, a negative refractive
index.

Numerical treatment of Bloch equations

Since the differential Bloch equations are linear, they can be easily solved. For example, the prescription
ρ
~(t) = eMt ρ
~(0)

(14.168)

propagates the Bloch vector to later times.
The matrix M is not invertible, but by applying the condition Tr ρ = 1, a component of the density matrix can be eliminated, for example by letting,
X
ρ11 = 1 −
ρkk .
(14.169)
k

The resulting state vector, ρ
~red , has the length n2 − 1, and from M we obtain the
(trace-)reduced, now invertible matrix Mred and the inhomogeneity vector b. The
differential equation is now,
d
ρ
~red = Mred ρ
~red + b ,
dt

(14.170)

with the stationary and time-dependent solutions,
ρ
~red (∞) = −M−1
red b

ρ
~red (t) = eMred t ρ
~red (0) + (1 − eMred t )~
ρred (∞) .
(14.171)
Once the matrix M or the matrix Mred and the inhomogeneity vector b are determined for a system, the state of the atom can be calculated at any time, as well as the
populations and coherences. The system’s free parameters are the natural transition
linewidths and the detunings, as well as the intensities and emission bandwidths of
the incident light fields.

Simulation of the Schrödinger and Bloch equation

Once we have written the solution of the Schrödinger equation in the form (6.102) with
a time-independent Hamiltonian Ĥ, or of the Bloch equations in the form (14.168)
or (14.171) with a time-independent Liouvillian M, we can easily simulate temporal
evolutions of quantum systems. If the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian depend on time, for
example, when the Rabi frequencies are pulsed or the detunings are ramped, we must
solve the equations iteratively. That is, we chose time intervals ∆t sufficiently short,

468

CHAPTER 14. THE BLOCH EQUATIONS

so that the Hamiltonian (or the Liouvillian) can be considered constant during this
interval, and we propagate the wavefunction (or the Bloch vector) to later times via:
|ψ(t + ∆t)i = eıĤ(t)∆t |ψ(t)i

ρ
~(t + ∆t) = eM(t)∆t ρ

or

(14.172)

and insert the solution obtained again into equations (14.172) with the Hamiltonian
Ĥ(t + ∆t) (or the Liouvillian M(t + ∆t)) adjusted to the new time.
Example 63 (Electromagnetically induced transparency ): In some special
cases, the three-level Bloch equations can be solved analytically. The system
in Λ-configuration schematized in Fig. 14.6(a), where the two lasers satisfy the
condition ∆12 = ∆23 can exhibit a dark resonance leading to the phenomena of
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and electromagnetically induced
absorption. In these resonances a dramatic change of the refractive index is
observed despite the fact that the atom becomes transparent, Re χ  0 and

General rules for setting up multilevel Bloch equations

The canonical way of deriving multi-level Bloch equations starts from a von Neumann
equation for the total density operator for the atom embedded in the electromagnetic
mode structure of the environment including incident laser beams. After tracing over
the degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic vacuum and using the Markov and the
Born approximations, one arrives at a master equation of the form [229],

of level |ki in to |li, and βkl is the emission bandwidth of the laser coupling the two
levels. Simple but tedious algebraic transformations of the master equation lead, in

the rotating wave approximation, to a set of linear first-order differential equations
in the populations of the atomic excitation levels and the coherences between them.
The equations are called the optical Bloch equations.
Alternatively, the Bloch equations may be found by breaking down the multi-level
scheme into a set of three-level systems. Respecting a few symmetry considerations,
the multi-level Bloch equations can then be reassembled from the three-level Bloch
equations corresponding to every possible combination of three levels. Based on such
considerations, we provide in the following a simple recipe for setting up Bloch matrices for arbitrary level schemes. A movie showing a simulation of multi-level Bloch
equations for Li atoms can be watched under the following link: (watch movie).
Let us regard a n-level atom. Its internal state is fully described by the populations
ρkk and the (complex) coherences ρkl , with k, l = 1, .., n. In this work we describe the
coherences by their real and imaginary parts. The labeling is such that the levels are
sorted according to their excitation energy, Ek < El for k < l. We define the Bloch
vector,

The different blocks of the matrix have the following significations. Block A handles the transfer of populations by spontaneous decay. Its rank corresponds to the
number of levels n. The diagonal elements of this block are the decay rates Γ of the
excited states. The off-diagonal elements Γkl denote the gain of level k from a decaying level l. Conservation of energy thus requires
P that the sum of the transition rates
cancels for every column of matrix A, Γ = k Γkl , as it is the case for the two-level
Bloch matrix. If the levels are sublevels of a Zeeman and/or hyperfine split multiplet,
the rates have to be weighted with Wigner’s (3j) and {6j} symbols, Γkl = ΓSkl . The
relative oscillator strengths Skl are given in Sec. 14.5.4.2.
The blocks Bk treat the interdependence of the populations and the coherences.
B1 describes how the coherence between any pair of states driven by a light field
generating a Rabi frequency Ωkl influences the populations. The block consists of

The Rabi frequencies have to be weighted not only with the relative oscillator strength
Skl , but also with the projection Hkl of the laser polarization onto the orientation
of the magnetic field and the laser polarization, Ωkl = Ωx Skl Hkl . Here Ωx is the
Rabi frequency generated by a laser on a transition, whose oscillator strength is 1.
The projection is calculated in Sec. 14.5.4.3 for the three possible laser polarizations,
i.e. for σ ± and for π light.
The matrix C rules the influence of the decays of the coherences, of the detunings
∆kl = ωx − ωatom , and the laser linewidths βkl . Note that the detuning of the laser
frequency ωx is negative for red-detuned light. In the chosen basis it breaks down
into an array 2 × 2 matrices aligned along the diagonal of M. Their shape is,

level is added to the detuning ∆kl . The shift is calculated in Sec. 14.5.4.4 for the
example of the 6 Li D2 line.
The block D governs the interdependences of all laser-driven coherences of the
atom. The block contains 2 × 2 submatrices at any place of the matrix M, where

Recipe for D transitions in alkalines

In order to give a simple algorithm we parametrize the particular choice of sorting the
components of the vector, we define a new index µ running from 1 to n2 by setting
(%µ ) ≡ (ρkl ), where,
µ(k, k) = k

(14.182)

µ(k, l) = 2nk − n − k − k + 2l − 1 ,
so that,

%µ(k,l) = Im ρkl
%µ(k,l)+1 = Re ρkl .
The Bloch equations then formally read,

We illustrate the procedure by considering the case of the 6 Li D2 line with 6
ground states k ∈ G ≡ {1, ..., 6} belonging to the 2 S1/2 hyperfine levels F = 21 , 32

Elliptical laser polarization

The transition rates additionally depend on the relative orientation of the laser polarizations and the magnetic field direction. This dependence is accounted for by
decomposing the polarization vector into the,

where ĝ is an arbitrarily chosen direction, e.g. gravity. The relative amplitude of the
transitions ∆mJ = 0 is proportional to the projection of the polarization vector on
the magnetic field axis ζ0 = (ε̂ · ê3 )2 for π-polarized light. To estimate the amplitude
of the transitions ∆mJ = ±1, we must project onto the coordinates,
ê± =

√1 (ê1

(14.194)

and we obtain ζ±1 = (ε̂ · ê± )2 for σ ± -polarized light. Hence,
Hkl = ζ∆mJ = ζml −mk .

(14.195)

With this generalization the Bloch equations can e.g. be employed to calculate
Hanle resonances quantum mechanically. The Hanle effect occurs when a magnetic
and an optical field compete for the quantization axis.

Ex: EIT & dark resonances

In this exercise we study so-called dark resonances, which are responsible for the
phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Such resonances are
observed in three-level systems |1i-|2i-|3i in Λ-configuration, as shown in Fig. 14.6(a),
when the laser detunings are chosen so as to satisfy ∆12 = ∆23 .
a. From the Bloch equations (14.164) show analytically that, in a stationary situation,
the population of the excited state is ρ22 (∞) = 0 in the center of the dark resonance.
Dark resonances can be observed experimentally. To reproduce the experiment by
numerical simulations of the Bloch equations (14.164), write down the Liouville matrix
Mred reduced by the trace condition (14.168) and calculate the stationary Bloch
vector from equation (14.169) varying the detunings of the two lasers ∆12 and ∆23 .
Choosing the parameters such that Γ23 = Γ12 , Γ13 = 0.01Γ12 , Ω12 = 2Γ12 , and
Ω23 = 0.2Γ12 , prepare a 3D curve [similar to Fig. 14.2(a)] of the population ρ22 (∞).
Interpret the results.

14.5.5.5

Ex: STIRAP

In experiments with cold atoms it is often necessary to transfer populations between
ground states, for example, between specific levels of a hyperfine structure. One
possible procedure is the method of optical pumping, from the initial ground state
to an excited state, which subsequently decays to the final state by spontaneous
emission. The problem with this incoherent procedure is, that one can control into
which ground state level the atom will decay, and that it heats atoms due to the
photonic recoil associated with the scattering of light. In this exercise we studied an
alternative method, called Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), which
allows the coherent transfer of population between two states by counter-intuitive
pulse sequences:
a. Consider a three-level system in Λ-configuration, as shown in Fig. 14.6(a), initially
being in the state |1i. Write the system’s Hamiltonian in the interaction picture.
Now, choose ∆12 = 0 = ∆23 , and a temporal variation of the Rabi frequencies
described by Ω12 (t) = Γ12 ( 12 + π1 arctan Γ12 t) and Ω23 (t) = Γ12 ( 12 − π1 arctan Γ12 t).
With this, solve the Schrödinger equation (14.172) iteratively within the time interval
t ∈ [−40/Γ12 , 40/Γ12 ], while continuously adjusting the Rabi frequencies.
b. The dynamics can also be calculated via a numerical simulations of the Bloch
equations (14.164). Write down the Liouville matrix and prepare a simulation using
the same parameters as in (b) and additionally Γ23 = Γ12 /2, Γ13 = Γ12 /500.
c. Interpret the results.

problem with this incoherent procedure is, that one can control into which ground
state level the atom will decay, and that it heats atoms due to the photonic recoil
associated with the scattering of light. In this exercise we study an alternative method,
called adiabatic sweep, which allows the coherent transfer of population between the
two outer states of a degenerate multiplet, as shown in Fig. 14.8, via an adiabatic
ramp of the frequency of the incident radiation:
a. Write down the Hamiltonian of the system in the interaction picture. Now, choose
Ω/2π = 8 kHz and apply a linear ramp of the radiation detuning between −50 kHz <
∆(t)/2π < 50 kHz during a time interval of 2 ms. With this, solve the Schrödinger
equation (14.164) iteratively varying the detuning.
b. Write down the Liouville matrix of the system and do a numerical simulation
of the Bloch equations (14.164) using the same parameters as in (a). Interpret the
results. What you observe when you introduce a decay rate between adjacent levels
of Γ/2π = 200 Hz?

Ex: Dispersive interaction between an atom and light

Radiation which is tuned far from a resonance can change the phase of an atomic
dipole moment without changing the populations 10 . We study this effect in a threelevel system in cascade configuration excited by two radiation fields, as illustrated in
Fig. 14.6(c), simulating the Schrödinger equation and the Bloch equations.
a. Write down the Hamiltonian Ĥ for this system letting ∆12 = 0.
b. Now, consider the subsystem |2i-|3i, write down its Hamiltonian Ĥ23 , determine
the eigenvalues, and assume that this transition be excited very far-off resonance.
That is, for ∆23  Ω23 , Γ23 expand the eigenvalues of Ĥ23 up to second order in Ω23 .
Finally, replace the submatrix Ĥ23 in the complete Hamiltonian Ĥ by the matrix
of the expanded eigenvalues. This procedure corresponds to treating the transition
|2i-|3i as a perturbation of the transition |1i-|2i until second order.

type of interaction is used in the implementation of quantum gates in quantum computing.

Ex: Gas with negative permeability

Theoretically, under certain conditions, gases may exhibit negative permittivity and
permeability, and therefore refraction [569]DOI , [567]DOI , [568]DOI , [470]DOI , [376].
To study this phenomenon we consider a three-level system in Λ-configuration with
an electric dipole transition and another magnetic dipole transition. The objective
is to balance the electrical dipole moment excited by a probe laser and the magnetic
dipole moment excited via a Raman transition by both, the probe laser and a control
laser. The Raman transition simulates an effective magnetic field. Since the magnetic
moment is smaller by a factor of α2 , the electric moment must be reduced by detuning
the probe laser, as shown in Fig. 14.9.

Atoms in quantized radiation
fields
So far we have treated the optical field only as a stationary or propagating classical
wave, while our two-level atom has been regarded as an entity obedient to the laws
of quantum mechanics and subject to an induced perturbation by an oscillatory electromagnetic field. This procedure naturally leads to oscillations of the atomic states’
populations and the coherences between them. However, in strong fields, when atomic
energy spectrum is significantly modified, a non-perturbative, time-independent approach can be fruitful. Time-independent solutions for the Schrödinger equation for
atoms coupled to fields is called dressed states. They were used for the first time to
interpret the splitting of rotational molecular spectra in the presence of intense classical radiofrequency fields. While the semiclassical treatment is suitable for a wide
variety of phenomena and has the virtue of mathematical simplicity and familiarity,
it is sometimes worth considering the field as a quantum entity as well. In the dressed
states picture, the atom-field interaction corresponds to an exchange of energy quanta
between the field (photons) and the atom. This approach allows us to express photonic number states, also called Fock states, on equal footings with the discrete states
of atom excitation and to write the state functions of the coupled atom-field system in
a basis of photonic and atomic product states. Diagonalization of the dipole coupling
terms in the system’s Hamiltonian generates time-independent solutions of dressed
states in a completely quantum Schrödinger equation.
We begin this chapter with the quantization of the light field and then express
the atom-field interaction in a fully quantized form. We will examine some examples
illustrating how the dressed states picture can provide useful information on the lightmatter interactions.

15.1

Quantization of the electromagnetic field

We have already seen that the energy of a monochromatic light field with frequency
ω is quantized in small equal portions, such that the total energy is n~ω, where n
is an integer number. The energy spectrum is the same as the one of the harmonic
oscillator. Therefore, we can identify a light mode with an oscillator and adopt the
entire formalism developed for the harmonic oscillator. The formalism will be assumed
as known in the following. We will, for simplicity use the term photon (respectively
phonon) for excitations of a harmonic oscillator mode. It is however important to be
481

482

CHAPTER 15. ATOMS IN QUANTIZED RADIATION FIELDS

aware that a photon is not a particle, as it simply disappears when performing the
transition from quantum to classical mechanics [377].

15.1.1

Field operators

The basic idea behind field quantization is the replacement of the classical harmonic
oscillators discussed in Sec. 3.5 by quantum oscillators. The simplest approach to
perform this quantization is to introduce the scalar potential Φ and the potential
vector A as done in electrodynamic theory 1 . In free space, without charges nor
currents, and within the Coulomb gauge we have the solution of the wave equation
(13.5) generalized to a distribution of wavevectors k 2 ,

where we already isolated the vectorial character due to the polarization ~k of the light

mode k. Obviously, A−
0k = (A0k ) . As each amplitude and polarization of the wave
given by the vector potential Ak and A∗k must satisfy the wave equation separately,
we arrive at the dispersion relation,
ωk = ck .

(15.2)

With the results (13.7) and (13.8) we know that the energy in each radiative mode
is,

(15.3)

where the bar denotes cycle-averaging. The second quantization now consists in
interpreting the mode as a quantum harmonic oscillator, that is, we understand the
0
observables as operators satisfying commutation rules, such as [Â0k , Â+
0k0 ] ∝ δk,k ,
and hence being affected by quantum fluctuations:

atom-light interaction may depend on the polarization of the light with respect to the
quantization axis of the atom, as defined e.g. by a magnetic field. In these cases we need to extend
the index k to include the polarization state (k, λ).

The result (15.6) is exactly Planck’s quantum hypothesis (although strictly speaking, he rather suggested a quantization of oscillators in the conducting walls of the
cavity, not of the field) on the distribution of the spectral intensity radiated by a black
body. We now can see that it follows naturally from the quantization of the cavity
field modes. Solve Excs. 15.1.4.1, Exc. 15.1.4.2, and 15.1.4.3.

Interaction of quantized fields with atoms

With the results of the previous section the complete field Hamiltonian reads,

Ĥf ield =
~ωk (â†k âk + 21 ) .

k

Now, that we have a clear picture of the quantized field with the energies in the
modes given by Eq. (15.9) and the photon number states given by the eigenstates |ni
of the quantized harmonic oscillator, we are in a position to consider our two-level
atom interacting with this quantized radiation field. If for the moment, we exclude
spontaneous emission and stimulated processes, the Hamiltonian of the combined
atom-field system is,
Ĥ = Ĥatom + Ĥf ield + Ĥatom:f ield .

(15.11)

We describe the atom by a two-level system,
Ĥatom = ~ωg |gihg| + ~ωe |eihe| = ~ωg |gihg| + ~(ωg + ω0 )|eihe| ,

(15.12)

where Ĥf ield is the Hamiltonian of the quantized field, expressed by Eq. (15.6), and
Ĥatom:f ield the atom-field interaction. For the Hamiltonian without interaction, Ĥ =
Ĥatom + Ĥf ield , the eigenstates are simply product states of the atomic states and
the photon number states,
|g, ni = |gi|ni

and

|e, ni = |ei|ni .

(15.13)

The left side of Fig. 15.1 shows, how the eigenenergies of the product states consist
of two ladders, being displaced by the energy difference ~∆, which corresponds to the

detuning. We write the Hamiltonian of the atom Eq. (15.12) as the sum of projectors
on unperturbed eigenstates using the completeness relation and the orthogonality
of eigenstates. With the same idea we can rewrite the dipole operator defined in
Eq. (13.30),

This Hamiltonian contains four terms describing the following processes 3 ,
|g, ni −→ |e, n − 1i the atom is excited by the absorption of a photon;
|e, ni −→ |g, n − 1i the atom is deexcited by the absorption of a photon;
|g, ni −→ |e, n + 1i the atom is excited by the emission of a photon;
|e, ni −→ |g, n + 1i the atom is deexcited by the emission of a photon;
Obviously, only the first and forth terms respect energy conservation (in first-order
processes) and can serve as initial and final states in real physical processes. Fig. 15.3
shows schemes of these four terms. We see, that neglecting the second and third
process (i.e., terms ∝ σ̂ ± â± of the Hamiltonian) is equivalent to making the rotating
wave approximation (RWA), where we despise the terms rotating with the frequency
±(ωk + ω0 ), and that we really only need to consider the coupling between the two
dressed states |g, ni and |e, n − 1i.
Finally, within the RWA the Hamiltonian reads,
Ĥatom:f ield = 2ı ~Ω(r)e−ı∆k t σ̂ + âk − 2ı ~Ω∗ (r)eı∆k t σ̂ − â†k ,

(15.19)

where we introduced the detuning ∆k ≡ ωk − ω0 as short hand notation.

Figure 15.2: Two-level atom interacting with a cavity mode.

It is important to note that the first and fourth term can be important in higher
order processes, such as multiphotonic absorption or Raman scattering processes,
where the excited state would be a virtual level. In fact, when the Rabi frequency
is very large, Ω ' ω, the excitation and deexcitation processes follow each other so
rapidly, that energy conservation can be violated for short times. The energy shift
caused by terms neglected in the RWA are called Bloch-Siegert shift 4 .
3 Remember that the four processes contained in the Hamiltonian are all coherent (absorption and
stimulated emission), and that spontaneous emission must be treated separately see next Sec. 15.4.
4 The shift is not observed, when the non-rotating terms σ ± a± are forbidden by other conservation
or selection rules. For example, when a resonance is excited by σ ± light, the RWA is accurate.

CHAPTER 15. ATOMS IN QUANTIZED RADIATION FIELDS

Dressed states

Within the new dressed states basis, the atom-light coupling problem is reduced to
diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a quasi-degenerate two-level atom (|∆|  ω0 ), in
which the non-diagonal elements are given by 21 ~Ω. The eigenenergies of the complete
Hamiltonian Ĥ are,
(15.20)
E± = ~2 (ωg,n + ωe,n−1 ) ± ~2 G .

where ~ωg,n and ~ωe,n−1 are the energies of the product states ~ωg + n~ωk and
~ωe + (n − 1)~ωk .

Figure 15.3: Illustration of the four processes in the atom-field interaction. Terms (b) and
(c) conserve energy in first-order processes, while (a) and (d) do not conserve.

The atom-field product states offer a natural basis for the Hamiltonian of Eq. (15.11).
The states resulting from the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian on this basis are
called dressed states. As indicated in Fig. 15.1, the neighboring doublets the double ladder ’repel’ each other under the influence of the interaction Ĥatom:f ield in
Eq. (15.11). The mixed coefficients form the familiar problem of two levels, now
called |ai and |bi. From Fig. 15.1 we see,

The Jaynes-Cummings model

The Jaynes-Cummings model describes the dynamics of a single dressed two-level
atom in a single monochromatic laser mode in the absence of spontaneous emission
processes. The model, illustrated in Fig. 15.2 has become a paradigm of quantum
mechanics with applications in quantum information, where it applies to the formulation of entanglement protocols of atomic states and the implementation of quantum
ports. In the following, we will first study the interaction of an atom with an optical
mode neglecting dissipation effects, leaving the discussion on the impact of dissipation
processes to later sections.
The dynamic evolution of pure states then follows the Schrödinger equation. The
Hamiltonian of this system is given by (15.18). Letting ~ = 1 and assuming that
the atom is located at the origin [such that Ω(r)eık·r = Ω(0)], we can write the
Hamiltonian as,
Ĥ = ωâ† â + ω0 (σ̂ + σ̂ − − 21 ) + 12 Ω(âσ̂ + + â† σ̂ − ) ,

(15.23)

where ω is the frequency of the radiation, ω0 the frequency of the atomic transition,
and Ω the Rabi frequency generated by a single photon. We choose the Fock representation for the radiation mode, we represent the atomic transitions by Pauli matrices,
and we span the product space ρ̂f ield ⊗ ρ̂atom generalizing the operators â± y â± ⊗ I

The temporal evolution follows with [331],
ρ̂(t) = e−ıĤn t ρ̂(0)eıĤn t ≡ L(t)ρ̂(0) .

(15.34)

A genuine phenomenon observed in the Jaynes-Cummings model, the temporal disappearance of any signatures of quantum coherence in the light field known as quantum
collapse and revival is studied in Exc. 15.2.4.1.

15.2.1

Classical and quantum limits

15.2.1.1

The limit of high laser intensities and resonant interaction

The classical limit is recovered for n → ∞, where a single photon makes no difference,
that is, we can treat the states |ni and |n+1i as equivalent. Then, we can approximate
the Hamiltonian of the system (15.25) by the trace of this same Hamiltonian taken
over the number of photons,
X
Ĥsemi = lim Trf ield ρ̂Ĥ =

This situation, as illustrated
in Fig. 15.5, describes well the state of a laser as a

coherent state, |αi = n √αn! |nie−|α| /2 . For n → ∞, the uncertainty of the Poisson
√
distribution is small, ∆n/n̄ = 1/ n → 0, such that the light mode is characterized
by the average number of photons, and fluctuations are negligible. This allows us to
replace the Poisson distribution, Pn = |hn|αi|2 = δnn̄ ,
Ĥsemi = Ĥf ield + Ĥatom + Ĥatom:f ield =

Obviously, the structure of the field |αi is not affected, and we recover the dynamics of a two-level atom excited by a resonant classical radiation as described
by the Bloch equations (14.62).

Figure 15.5: Atomic level scheme for the implementation of resonant interactions with classical radiation fields (on the lower transition) and dispersive interactions with quantum fields
(on the upper transition).

15.2.1.2

Dispersive interaction, the limit of large detunings

The dispersive Jaynes-Cummings dynamics can be implemented by irradiating a light
field, which is sufficiently detuned to avoid Rayleigh scattering processes, as shown
√ in
Fig. 15.5. This interaction results in a phase shift of the atomic levels. For |∆|  nΩ
we consider the radiative coupling as a small perturbation,

The fact that the ground and excited atomic states evolve with different phase factors
is important, as we will show in the following example.

492

CHAPTER 15. ATOMS IN QUANTIZED RADIATION FIELDS
Example 65 (Dispersive π-pulse): As in the previous case, we consider a
two-level atom subject to a coherent field, but now tuned out of resonance.

The fact that the phase shift nϕ depends on the number of photons, and that
it goes in opposite directions for the ground and excited states, is crucial. We
have already studied in Exc. 14.5.5.7, that the dispersive interaction of the
atom with a radiation field can phase-shift the Bloch vector. Now, we observe
that in addition, it causes a phase shift of the probability amplitude of having
n photons in the radiation field by a value proportional to n, i.e. (ignoring
irrelevant dynamical phases),

(15.47)

Apparently, the phase of the radiation field is shifted by a value ϕ, which depends
on the state of the atom.

We note here, that the dynamics studied in the last example provides a method
of transferring coherence from an atomic superposition to a quantum correlation of
a radiation field. All we have to do, is to bring the atom into a superposition of
states |1i + |2i, and the field will automatically evolve toward a Schrödinger cat state
|αeıϕ i + |αe−ıϕ i. The transfer of quantum correlations between coupled degrees of
freedom is one of the characteristics of the Jaynes-Cummings model. As examples
we will study the phenomena of quantum collapse and revival in Exc. 15.2.4.2 and of
vacuum Rabi splitting in 15.2.4.3.

15.2.2

Observables and quantum correlations of the JaynesCummings dynamics

In the limit of low laser intensities we must consider photonic distributions that are
not necessarily coherent. The stationary solution of the Schrödinger equation consists
of the dressed states |1, ni and |2, n−1i. If we now expand a general Jaynes-Cummings
state in amplitudes cjn (t),
|ψi =

The evolution of the coefficients cjn completely describes the Jaynes-Cummings dynamics of the system through the formula (15.32). Obviously, the Jaynes-Cummings
state is normalized because,
X
hψ|ψi = Tr |ψihψ| =
(|c1,n |2 + |c2,n |2 ) = 1 .
(15.50)
n

As dissipation processes are neglected, we get a pure state described by,
ρ̂ = |ψihψ| .

(15.51)

The Jaynes-Cummings dynamics involves two coupled degrees of freedom characterized by with their respective observables. If we are interested in them, we can do
two things: (a) We ignore the degrees of freedom NOT under study by NOT DOING
a measurement of the other degrees. That is, we simply remove the non-interesting
degrees of freedom from the state. For example, if our focus is on the optical mode,
we ignore the atomic state,

|γi ≡

Again, our new density operator remains pure, that is,

(b) We trace over the degrees of freedom NOT under study by DOING a measurement.
For example, if again our focus is on the optical mode, we trace over the atomic states,

It is clear, that this incomplete measurement converts the reduced density operator
into a statistical mixture, which is free of inneratomic correlations of the type c∗2,m c1,n ,
but this means that we also loose possible field correlations. On the other hand,

(15.63)

We will derive this result in Exc. 15.2.4.4. This quantity, called Q-function, allows
the illustration of the state in a coordinate system spanned by Re α and Im α [74].
It is generally easy to calculate, but does not exhibit much information, e.g., on
interference phenomena caused by quantum correlations. In the following section,
we will calculate the Wigner function, which can also be evaluated from the JaynesCummings coefficients [200].

(a) Bloch vector, (b,c) photon distribution after projection on the ground and excited atomic
state, (d) time evolution of the coherence ρ12 showing the phenomenon of collapse and revival,
and (e) W (α) function.

The Jaynes-Cummings dynamics illustrated in Fig. 15.6 demonstrates the transfer
of coherence between an atom and a light field. In Exc. 15.2.4.5 we study how to
create, via a sequence of Ramsey pulses, a Schrödinger cat state in a light field.
15.2.2.4

The Wigner function in the Glauber picture

We found in (15.44) that a dispersive phase shift of the atomic state |2i leads to a
time-dependent phase shift of the Glauber field,

Now, what happens if we MEASURE the atomic state before we analyze the field
state? The incomplete measurement corresponds to tracing over the atomic degrees
of freedom, which transforms our initially pure state (15.67) into a statistical mixture.

Calculating the Wigner function from this density operator consequently must yield
a different result, because any correlations are lost. A movie of the dynamics can be
watched here (watch movie) [106, 157, 7, 623].
15.2.2.5

The Wigner function in the Fock picture

Let us now calculate the Wigner function in the Fock state picture. This will allow
us to consider more general states later on. We start from the expansion,
X

|ψi =

n

c1,n |1, ni + c2,n−1 |2, n − 1i .

(15.72)

As before, we can now choose to DO or NOT DO a measurement of the atomic state.
If we do a measurement tracing over the atomic states, we calculate the normally
ordered characteristic function using the density operator (15.56),

Obviously, this formula does not contain inneratomic correlations and, since nonclassical field correlation would be entangled with atomic superposition states, we
expect no interesting field correlations, neither.

express the characteristic functions by Laguerre polynomials and obtain the Wigner

Exc. 15.2.4.7.

We will show in this exercise how, via coherent operations in a three-level system,

system shown in Fig. 15.7 we imagine the lower transition excited by π/2-pulses of a
classical resonant microwave radiation (as described by the operation (15.37)). The
upper transition is excited by quantum laser pulses tuned very far out of resonance,
thus creating a dispersive dynamics (as described by the operation (15.37)). At time
t = 0 the atom is in state

microwave pulse with n̄Ω12 t = π/2, (ii) an optical pulse with Ω223 t/4∆23 = π,
(iii) another microwave π/2-pulse, and finally (iv) an optical pulse of light which is

Correlation functions

In the preceding sections and in Sec. 3.7 we have learned, how to characterize quantum
fields by (quasi-)probability distribution functions, and how to represent correlations
in the Fock or the Glauber basis. But we did not propose experimental schemes
allowing to detect them. Experimental devices, such as interferometers or photon
correlators, necessarily involve space or time coordinates. Hence, we need to devise
quantities for the characterization of correlations, that are compatible with experimental devices. The correlation functions are such quantities, and in the next section
we will focus our attention them.
In order to be able to distinguish classical from genuinely quantum correlations,
we will first a classical description, before introducing a quantum description of the
light field [389].

500

15.3.1

CHAPTER 15. ATOMS IN QUANTIZED RADIATION FIELDS

Classical first and second order coherence

The coherence properties of a light field (or a matter wave) are measured by nth space
time order correlation functions. In quantum mechanics, these are defined by,
hÊ − (r1 , t1 )..Ê − (rn , tn )Ê + (rn+1 , tn+1 )..Ê + (r2n , t2n )i
g (n) (r1 , t1 , .., r2n , t2n ) ≡ q
.
hÊ − (r1 , t1 )Ê + (r1 , t1 )i..hÊ − (r2n , t2n )Ê + (r2n , t2n )i
(15.78)
In the following, we will only consider temporal coherences, e.g. one or more collinear
light beams, km k kn , impinging on a photodetector, (tm − zcm ) − (tn − zcn ) = τ , since
Ê(r, t) = Ê(ωt − k · r), we can define the the 1st and 2nd order correlation functions
g (1) and g (2) , which are particularly important,
g (1) (τ ) ≡

hÊ − (t)Ê + (t + τ )i
hÊ − (t)Ê + (t)i

and

g (2) (τ ) ≡

hÊ − (t)Ê − (t + τ )Ê + (t + τ )Ê + (t)i
hÊ − (t)Ê + (t)i2

.

(15.79)
Ignoring the quantized nature of light, we may substitute the field operators by complex numbers, Ê + → E and Ê − → E ∗ and interprete the brackets as pure time
averages,
Z
1 t
h· · ·it = lim
· · · dt .
(15.80)
t→∞ t 0
Defining the intensity as I = 2ε0 cE ∗ E, the coherences become,
2
and
g (2) (τ ) ≡ 2εI0 c hI(t)I(t + τ )i . (15.81)
g (1) (τ ) ≡ 2εI0 c hE ∗ (t)E(t + τ )i
The correlation functions must be calculated from the field operators simultaneously
respecting time order and normal order. These functions are useful quantities to describe phenomena such as photon bunching or to understand the fluorescence spectra
or the scattering of light from correlated atoms. g (1) measures the coherence of a
light field (how much it resembles a sine wave). g (2) measures, for a given degree of
coherence, the deviation of the light field from the quantum state that most closely
approximates a classical light (how much it resembles a laser).
The correlation functions g (1) and g (2) are experimentally measured in Young’s
experiment and in the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiment. The experimental schemes
are explained in Figs. 15.8.
Coherence and chaos are contrary properties of light. They leave their imprint
in the spectrum of the light or in the autocorrelation functions. The emission spectrum of a light source generally emerges as a combination of various physical effects: The active medium gives rise resonances and broadenings, a resonator containing the active medium imprints a modal structure, and the coupling to a thermal bath gives rise to P
a thermal distribution of the radiation energy according to
Pn = e−~ω(n+1/2)/kB T / n e−~ω(n+1/2)/kB T .

Coherent and chaotic light

The temporal and spectral properties of a light field are largely determined by the
processes leading to its generation in the light source, that is, whether the light is
generated by stimulated or spontaneous emission, by a laser or by blackbody radiation,
by a single atom or by atomic gases subject to collisional and Doppler-broadening.
15.3.3.1

Correlation functions for laser light

First-order coherent light satisfies |g (1) (τ )| = 1, incoherent light |g (1) (τ )| = 0, and
for partially coherent light, we get intermediate values. Second-order coherent light
satisfies g (2) (−τ ) = g (2) (τ ) and 1 ≤ g (2) (0) ≤ ∞ and 0 ≤ g (2) (τ ) ≤ ∞ and g (2) (0) ≥

g (2) (τ ) → c 1. Let us now look at some specific cases, for which the correlation
functions and spectra can be calculated.

We see, that the first-order coherence decays exponentially, |g (1) (τ )| = e−γ|τ | 6 , such
that the spectrum has a Lorentzian profile. This result has already been derived in
Sec. 13.3.1 for the natural linewidth of a transition subject to spontaneous emission.
We understand the connection by interpreting spontaneous emission as being induced
by vacuum fluctuations, which do have a white noise spectrum, indeed.
Example 66 (Laser broadening due to spontaneous emission): Laser light
is generated by stimulated emission on a transition between two quantized levels. The alternance of absorption and stimulated emission induces coherent
Rabi oscillations ensuring the coherence of the emitted light. But we have seen
earlier that spontaneous emission leads to randomly occurring interruptions of
the coherent Rabo oscillations. The probability of finding a coherent interval
decreases exponentially with the evolution time,
p(τ )dτ = γe−γτ dτ ,

that, in order to satisfy (15.86), we must take the absolute value of the delay |τ |.

Correlation functions with pressure broadening

the same frequency, but being randomly interrupted by phase jumps,

Spontaneous emission and light scattering

15.4.1

Interaction of atoms with vacuum modes

The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (15.11), discussed in Sec. 15.2, describes the
purely coherent dynamics of a single immobile two-level atom interacting with a single
cavity mode. The model is simple enough to allow for analytical solutions. However,
it does not include processes of spontaneous emission, which can be understood as
the interaction of the atom with the light modes of the vacuum. That is, we must
extend the Hamiltonian,
Ĥ = Ĥatom + Ĥf ield + Ĥatom:f ield + Ĥvacuum + Ĥatom:vacuum .

(15.101)

The evolution of the system represented by the Hamiltonian (15.101) is described by
a total density operator, ρ̂total (t), obeying the von Neumann equation,
ı
dρ̂total
= − [Ĥ, ρ̂total ] ,
dt
~

(15.102)

ρ̂total (t) = e−ıĤt/~ ρ̂total (0)eıĤt/~ ≡ e−ıLt ρ̂total (0) .

(15.103)

which has the solution,

Often, we are only interested in either the evolution of the light field, or the
internal state of the atom. In these cases, we calculate the trace over all those degrees
of freedom, which are we are NOT interested in,
ρ̂atom = Trlight ρ̂total

and

ρ̂light = Tratom ρ̂total .

(15.104)

The procedure is the following. We begin choosing the initial state of the electromagnetic vacuum as the photonic vacuum ρ̂f ield = |{0}ih{0}| and defining a projection
operator onto this state, P̂ ... ≡ ρ̂f ield (0)Trf ield ... = P̂ 2 .... Then we apply to the
von Neumann equation the rotating wave, the Markov and the Born approximations.

15.4. SPONTANEOUS EMISSION AND LIGHT SCATTERING

507

Finally, tracing over the vacuum field variables, we obtain after some calculations the
Bloch-Lindbladt equation or master equation [508] for the atom interacting with the
driving field. For a discussion of the validity of the Born-Markov approximation [454].
For the relation between the Markov approximation and the Fermi’s Golden Rule [8].
We emphasize that the Hamiltonian (15.101) describes the interaction of light
with a single immobile atom at the most fundamental level. However, it excludes
many-body effects introduced by quantum statistics or interatomic interactions (to
be discussed in Chp. 26.9), as well as the center-of-mass motion of the atom and the
impact of photonic recoil (to be discussed in Chp. 19.4).
In the following section we give a simplified derivation concentrating us on the
situation of a single motionless atom, excited by a laser and emitting photons into
the electromagnetic vacuum.
15.4.1.1

The spontaneous emission

Spontaneous emission can be understood as an energy diffusion process from a system
with a restricted number of degrees of freedom into a large thermal bath. For example, although a two-dimensional Hilbert space is sufficient to describe a laser-driven
two-level atom, this atom couples to a huge phase-space by spontaneously emitting
photons into arbitrary directions. We account for his fact by including in the Hamiltonian not only the interaction of the atom with the incident laser (wavevector k0 ,
frequency ωk0 , coupling force gk0 ), but also with the modes of the electromagnetic
vacuum (wavevector k, frequency ωk , coupling force gk ). We will see, that with this
Hamiltonian, we can derive, in a calculation is known as Weisskopf-Wigner theory,
the Schrödinger equation for the amplitudes of the atomic levels (14.95) including
spontaneous emission.

the ground state |gi and excited state |ei. Since we are considering only one atom
fixed in space 7 , we can as well locate it at the origin r = 0. In addition, considering
a high power incident laser,

The Markov approximation

For small systems (which is the case of a single atom), we can apply the Markov approximation 8 claiming that the temporal variation of the amplitudes β(t0 ) is slower
than the evolution of the system given by eı(ωk −ωa )t in the integro-differential equation, which is equivalent to an arbitrarily high-order equation. Hence, substituting
β(t0 ) → β(t) into the integro-differential equation, we reduce it to a simple first-order
differential equation. Redefining the integration variable, t00 ≡ t − t0 , we get,

Example 67 (Emission stimulated by vacuum fluctuations): Spontaneous
emission can be regarded as an emission stimulated by vacuum fluctuations. To
see this, we write down the resonant optical cross section of a driven two-level
atom without degeneracies, σ0 = λ2 /2π, and the intensity of an incident laser
field, I¯ = cN ~ω0 /V , generating the Rabi frequency,

15.4.2

Resonance fluorescence and (in-)coherent light scattering

The typical situation for a spectroscopy experiment is illustrated in Fig. 15.11: When
a beam of light, understood as a plane wave, strikes an atom (or a cloud of many
atoms), a part of the light is absorbed and reemitted into a direction indicated by a
solid angle dΩ. Light scattering is, of course, a second order process involving two
atomic transitions, one absorption and one emission.

Figure 15.11: (a) Geometry of a scattering experiment. (b) Spectral contributions of light
scattered elastically and inelastically by a three-level atom.

Radiation can be absorbed or scattered by an atom in different ways, depending
on whether the interaction is an elastic scattering or an inelastic scattering process,
a coherent or incoherent, a spontaneous or (bosonically) stimulated process. These
properties characterize many processes, in particular, resonance fluorescence (i.e. absorption and reemission), Rayleigh scattering, or Raman scattering. In the following,
we will clarify this classification.
Every scattering process is either spontaneous or stimulated 9 . Rayleigh scattering
is elastic, that is, the kinetic energy of the scattering atom is the same, before and
after the scattering process. In contrast, Raman scattering is inelastic. Spontaneous
emission is due to the decay of population from an excited state, and spontaneous
Rayleigh scattering is due to the decay of an induced dipole moment. Both spontaneous processes can be regarded as being stimulated by vacuum fluctuations.
9 Classical theories of light scattering through the excitation of an electronic motion based on the
models of Lorentz or Drude can be found in the script Electrodynamics. Although being classical,
these model are useful for a deeper understanding of many aspects of Compton scattering, Thomson
scattering, and Rayleigh scattering.

Deriving the source field expression

We will now calculate the electric field due to spontaneous emission by an atom from
the interaction Hamiltonian for atom-vacuum coupling (15.105) in the RWA,

Now, we assume isotropic coupling, gk = gk , and ωk = ωk , and for simplicity we
position the atom in the origin, R = 0. We use the Heisenberg equation with the
commutation rule [âk , â†k0 ] = δk,k0 to derive the temporal evolution of the field operators,

When we introduced the second quantization (15.8) we learned that the field of light
emitted by a radiator in the radiation zone (λ  r) is, taking into account retardation 10 , given by,

15.4.3.1

The quantum regression theorem

From (15.85) we see that, to compute the spectra of resonance fluorescence, we only
need to compute the correlation function g (1) , i.e. the amplitudes of the field Ê(t),
which in turn are related to the field operators (15.8). The field operators follow the
solutions of the Bloch equation, which, being linear, have the following generic form,
ρij (t + τ ) =

X

αijkl (τ )ρij (t) + βij (τ ) .

(15.136)

k,l

The trace condition is satisfied, when (i, j), (k, l) 6= (1, 1).
To be able to explore this relationship (15.85), needed to calculate the correlation
functions, we have to invoke the so-called quantum regression theorem,
hÂ(t + τ )i =

X

ξi (τ )hÂi (t)i

=⇒

i

hB̂(t)Â(t + τ )Ĉ(t)i =

have,
Ȧµ = Dµ (t) + Fµ (t)

(15.138)

0

hFµ (t)Fν (t)i = 2hDµν iδ(t − t ) .
We know,
hAµ (t)Fν (t)i = hDµν i

and

hFµ (t)Aν (t)i = hDµν i

(15.139)

and the quantum regression theorem gives,
d
hAµ (t)Aν (t0 )i = hDµ (t)Aν (t0 )i ,
dt

(15.140)

because if t0 < t, the term hFµ (t)Aν (t0 )i vanishes for a Markovian process.

15.4.3.2

Bloch equation for a two-level system

The Fourier transform of the first-order coherence, g (1) (τ ) = e−ıωτ G(τ ), gives,
F (ν) = (Fg (1) )(ν) = F[e−ıωτ ] ? F[G(τ )] = δ(ν − ω) ? F[G(τ )] = (FG)(ν − ω) .
(15.141)
Therefore, we can look at the unshifted spectrum, (FG)(ν). Since the fluorescence
spectrum is determined by the first-order coherence, which depends on the field operators, which in turn depend on the atomic populations and coherences, we have to
solve the Bloch equation.
For a two-level atom the Bloch equations, having been reduced by the normalization condition (14.169) are,

hσ̂22 (t)i = hσ̂12 (t)σ̂21 (t)i = ρ22 (t) .

Correlation functions

We now look at the radiation field, which is related to the dipole moment operator
via,
Ê − = γ σ̂21 ,
(15.149)
where γ is simply a constant. Substituting this relation in the correlation functions
(15.79) we obtain,

hσ̂21 (t)σ̂12 (t + τ )i
hσ̂21 (t)σ̂12 (t + τ )i

These correlation functions can easily be calculated via a numerical resolution of the
Bloch equations (15.142). Fig. 15.13 shows the correlation functions and the fluorescence spectrum derived by Fourier transform of the first-order correlation function
(15.84). Assuming resonant excitation, ∆ = 0, analytic formulas can be derived, as

Mollow spectrum obtained by numerical FFT of g (1) (τ ).

The spectrum 15.13(d) exhibits three lines known as the Mollow triplet. Note that
the spontaneous emission triplet is only observed in the presence of a driving laser,
because it is the laser excitation which causes the splitting. Indeed, the splitting and
the position of the lines are easily understood in the dressed states picture visualized
in Fig. 15.1: The coupling of the two-level atom to a light field splits up the levels |ni
and |n + 1i by an amount corresponding to the Rabi frequency Ω. Now, the transition
from the two excited state |n + 1i levels to the ground state |ni levels can occur on
three different frequencies. In Exc. 15.4.4.5 we calculate the Mollow spectrum for a
transition between one ground and three excited Zeeman states. Fig. 15.14 illustrates
the various methods to analyze scattered light, but not all of them yield information
on the Mollow triplet.
15.4.3.4

Mollow spectrum from effective Hamiltonian

The Mollow triplet is easily understood in the dressed states picture. On the other
hand, we know that (for classical light) the semi-classical picture is totally equivalent
(its just a unitary transform of the dressed states picture). Developing a physical
picture the Mollow triplet in the semi-classical framework may give us a deeper insight.
Generally, the Mollow spectrum is anyhow calculated using the semi-classical Bloch
equations, via the correlation function g (1) (τ ) and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem,
but the on the way the physical intuition is lost.
For example, looking at the stationary solution of the Bloch equations (14.99), we
see that ρ
~(∞) is time-independent, so that we might be surprised to see correlations

in time domain (and consequently a structured spectrum) at all. This surprise results from a common misconception that may arise considering the damping of ρ
~(t)
predicted by the Bloch model, as illustrated e.g. in Fig. 14.2: It seems that the atoms
eventually cease oscillating between the ground and excited states. In most experiments, measurement are made on a large number of atoms and indeed the oscillations
are damped.
In fact, however, every individual atom undergoes a complicated unpredictable
trajectory alternating times of coherent evolution with spontaneous emission events
(called quantum jumps). The damped behavior only results as an average over many
such quantum trajectories. In this light, the reason for g (1) -type correlations is a
subtle interplay between coherently and incoherently scattered light: The spontaneous
emission probability is amplitude-modulated with the Rabi frequency.
An alternative way to calculate the Mollow spectrum consists in solving the
Schrödinger equation with the effective Hamiltonian, as done in Exc. 15.4.4.2 and
15.4.4.6. The results are shown in Fig. 15.15. While providing an intuitive picture
of the origin of of the Mollow triplet a quantitatively correct treatment requires a
Monte-Carlo wavefunction simulation [441] (see Sec. 16.1.2).

Weak excitation and the role of collisions

These functions show that the spectrum is essentially composed of Rayleigh scattering
at the frequency of the incident light. The δ-shaped fluorescence spectrum shows,
that the contribution of elastically scattered light dominates below saturation, which
confirms the results (15.134) illustrated in Fig. 15.12. The light is ’antibunched’ and,
at higher τ exhibits a damped oscillation around the value 1.
If pressure broadening is taken into account, the two-level Bloch equations are
given by (14.99), where γ 0 = γ + γcoll is the width of the collision-broadened line.
Within this model and in the limit Ω  Γ, the resonance fluorescence spectrum is
given by [389],

15.5

Light scattering from multi-level atoms

15.5.1

Quantum beats

The phenomenon of quantum beats is another simple example of effects beyond semiclassical theory, requiring a full second-quantized calculation. In semi-classical theory
(SCT), there is an interference or beat note term for both V-type and Λ-type atoms,
while in quantum electrodynamics (QED) only V-type atoms exhibits a beat term.
In the semi-classical picture, the state vector of electrons is [565],
ψ(t)i = c1 e−ıω1 t |1i + c2 e−ıω2 t |2i + c3 e−ıω3 t |3i .

(15.157)

Writing the non-vanishing dipole matrix elements as d12 = eh1|r|2i, d23 = eh2|r|3i a
three-level atom has two microscopic oscillating dipoles,
P (t) = d12 (c∗1 c2 )eıω12 t + d23 (c∗2 c3 )eıω23 t + c.c. .

(15.158)

In the semi-classical picture, the radiated field will be a sum of these two terms,
E + = E1 e−ıω12 t + E2 e−ıω23 t .

(15.159)

This leads to an interference or beat note term in a square-law detector,
∗
|E + |2 = |E12 |2 + |E23 |2 + E12
E23 e[ı(ω12 −ω23 )t] + c.c. ,

(15.160)

regardless of whether state |2i decays simultaneously to |1i and |3i or vice versa.

Figure 15.16: Level configuration of a Λ-system (left) and a V -system (right).

15.5.1.1

Quantum electrodynamics calculation

For the quantum electrodynamical calculation, we use the creation and annihilation
operators from second quantization of quantum mechanics. Let Ên+ = ân e−ıωn t be
the annihilation operator and Ên− = â†n eıωn t be the creation operator with n = (12)
or n = (23). Then the beat note becomes,

(t)|ψV (t)i

and

−
+
hψΛ (t)|Ê12
(t)Ê23
(t)|ψΛ (t)i

(15.161)

for the Λ and the V -system, respectively. The state vector for each type of system is,
X
|ψV (t)i =
ci |i, 0i + c1 |c, 112 i + c2 |c, 123 i
(15.162)

i=1,2,3

521

c0i |i, 0i + c01 |b, 112 i + c02 |c, 123 i .

(15.163)

The beat note term becomes,
hψV (t)|Ê1− (t)Ê2+ (t)|ψV (t)i = κh112 023 |a†1 a2 |012 123 ie[ı(ω12 −ω23 )t] h3|3i

0 [ı(ω12 −ω23 )t]

=κe

(15.165)

h2|3i

for the Λ-system. However, orthogonality of the eigenstates requires h3|3i = 1 and
h2|3i = 0. Therefore, there is a quantum beat note term for V-type atoms, but not
for Λ-type atoms.
This difference originates in quantum mechanical uncertainty. A V-type atom
decays to state |3i via the emission with ω12 and ω23 . Since both transitions decayed
to the same state, one cannot determine along which path each decayed, similar to
Young’s double-slit experiment. However, Λ-type atoms decay to two different states.
Therefore, in this case we can identify the path by the end product.
Quantum beat spectroscopy is a technique which allows for Doppler-free resolution
provided the separation of the adjacent levels is less than the Doppler width. It
consists in generating a coherently distributed population of two upper states, e.g. via
a short laser pulse, and detecting the beat frequency.

15.5.2

Two-photon transitions

We will now apply the Kramers-Heisenberg formula (6.115) to photon scattering processes ω → ωs . The states are then product states of atomic excitations and photonic
modes |m, n, ns i. In particular, the final state must take into account the mode into

The upper signs hold for absorbed photons (up to n), the lower for emitted photons,
ωf = Ef + ω1 + ... + ωn and ωi = Ei + ω1 + ... + ωn .
For n-photon processes, there are theoretically up to n + 1 different types, each
one with n! possible temporal sequences, which can be illustrated in Feynman graphs.
Additionally, for every emitted photon can be either spontaneous or stimulated. The
number of possible time sequences is reduced, if some absorbed or emitted photons
have the same frequency by m! (if m is the number og identical photons).
For example there are (3+1) different types of three-photon processes: 3 photons
in, 2 photons in 1 out, 1 photon in 2 out, 3 photons out.
For example second harmonic generation: 3! possible time sequences, 2 processes,

Beam splitting and quantum amplification

We have learned in Sec. 15.2 how a two-level quantum systems couples to a harmonic
oscillator via terms in the Hamiltonian containing expressions such as σ̂+ â. We will
now see how two quantum harmonic oscillators couple together via terms such as â† b̂,
where â and b̂ are the field operators of two oscillator modes. A device providing such
a coupling is called beam splitter. It mixes two modes according to the Hamiltonian,
Ĥ = ~2 Ω(âb̂† + â† b̂) .

(15.189)

The beam splitter can be described in the Schrödinger or the Heisenberg picture
exploiting the formalism introduced in Sec. 3.5.

15.6.1

The beam splitter in various representations

15.6.1.1

Schrödinger picture

In the Schrödinger picture, if |ψ0 i = |α0 i|β0 i is the state of the modes before the
beam splitter, the Schrödinger equation, ı~∂t |ψ(t)i = Ĥ|ψ(t)i, gives us the state after
the splitter via its solution,
†

|ψ(t)i = eıΩt/2(âb̂

+â† b̂)

|ψ0 i .

(15.190)

A 50% beam splitter corresponds to a Ωt = π/2 pulse.
15.6.1.2

Heisenberg picture

We can also describe the beam splitter in the Heisenberg picture. With the commutation rules,
[â, â† ] = 1 = [b̂, b̂† ]
,
[â, b̂] = 0 ,
(15.191)
and the Heisenberg equations,
â˙ = ~ı [Ĥ, â] = 2ı Ω[(âb̂† + â† b̂), â] = − 2ı Ωb̂

11 This fact is a consequence of time-reversal invariance at the beam splitter. We will see later that,
in fact, only the beam reflected at the surface of an optically denser medium suffers a phase-shift of
π, while the beam reflected at an optically thinner medium does not suffer any phase shift.

where the |ψi are arbitrary quantum states and the |γi are Glauber’s states. This
means that two field modes mixed at a beam splitter do not interfere with phase
space, i.e. do not develop quantum correlations. Of course, that would be too easy,
indeed; we will soon see in Sec. 3.8, that we need to work a little harder to produce
quantum correlations.
Setting θ ≡ Ωt/2 and b̂ y −ıb̂ in the propagator of Eq. (15.190), we may define a
beam splitting operator in analogy to the displacement operator (3.106),

Alternatively, we can describe the beam splitter in the Fock representation 13 . The
Hamiltonian of the beam splitter couples two modes of harmonic oscillators. Expanding on a two-dimensional Fock basis via |ψi ≡ (...|0i|na i....|nb i|0i...) we can gain more

does not mean that the output modes are uncorrelated. For instance, if we measure n
photons in one mode, we know that the other must contain exactly N − n photons. However, the
correlations are so dense in phase space that they are not resolvable or decohere rapidly. In fact, it
can be shown that coherent states are the only pure states that produce uncorrelated outputs when
mixed by a passive linear-optics device [7, 6].

Shot noise

As any quantized degree of freedom, a light mode is subject to intrinsic quantum noise
imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, as we have seen for the harmonic
oscillator (3.118). The Heisenberg limit in the quadrature phases of a light field
determines the shot noise noise in the intensity of the light beam. To measure this
noise, we divide the laser beam by a beam splitter into two beams â and b̂ and
recombine them with a second beam splitter,
ĉ =

√1 (â

+ b̂)

,

dˆ =

√1 (â

(15.213)

Detected by photodetectors with the gain coefficient g, these two beams produce
currents,
Iˆc = gĉ† ĉ
,
Iˆd = g dˆ† dˆ .
(15.214)

532

CHAPTER 15. ATOMS IN QUANTIZED RADIATION FIELDS

We add and subtract these currents,
Iˆ+ ≡ Iˆc + Iˆd = g(â† â + b̂† b̂)

,

Iˆ− ≡ Iˆc − Iˆd = g(â† b̂ + b̂† â) .

15.6.4

Quantum amplifier

We will call in the following as quantum signals degrees of freedom subject to quantum
noise. Typically a quantum signal will be a mode of an electric field, represented by an
annihilation operator â. Such a mode can be enhanced by quantum amplifier, which
is a device amplifying quantum signals according to the rules of quantum mechanics.
Examples include the active elements of lasers and optical parametric amplifiers. A
quantum amplifier is characterized by its gain and its own intrinsic quantum noise,
which are interdependent parameters; the higher the gain, the larger the uncertainty
noise. In the case of lasers, the uncertainty corresponds to the amplified spontaneous
emission of the active medium.
Quantum amplification is a unitary transformation Û , acting in an initial state
|ini and producing (in the Schrödinger figure) the amplified state,
|outi = Û |ini .

(15.220)

15.6. BEAM SPLITTING AND QUANTUM AMPLIFICATION

533

The amplification depends on the mean value hâi of the annihilation operator and
its dispersion hâ† âi − hâ† ihâi. A coherent state is a state with minimal uncertainty;
when the state is transformed, the uncertainty may increase. This increase can be
interpreted as noise in the amplifier. The gain G can be defined as follows:
G=

hâiout
.
hâiin

(15.221)

The quantum amplifier can also be described in the Heisenberg picture; the
changes are attributed to the amplification of the field operator. Thus, the evolution of the operator âout is given by
âout = Û † âÛ ,

(15.222)

while the state vector remains unchanged. The gain is then given by,
G=

hâout iin
.
hâiin

(15.223)

In general, the gain G may be complex, and it may depend on the initial state. For
laser applications, the amplification of coherent states is important. Therefore, it is
usually assumed that the initial state is a coherent state characterized by a complexvalued initial parameter α, such that |ini = |αi. Even with such a restriction, the
gain may depend on the amplitude or phase of the initial field.
In the following, the Heisenberg representation is used; all brackets are assumed
to be evaluated with respect to the initial coherent state,
noise = hâ†out âout i − hâ†out ihâout i − (hâ† âi − hâ† ihâi) .

(15.224)

The expectation values are assumed to be evaluated with respect to the initial coherent
state. This quantity characterizes the increase of the uncertainty of the field due
to amplification. As the uncertainty of the field operator does not depend on its
parameter, the quantity above shows how much output field differs from a coherent
state.
15.6.4.1

Linear phase-invariant amplifier

Linear phase-invariant amplifiers may be described as follows. Assume that the unitary operator U amplifies in such a way that the input â and the output âout = Û † âÛ ,
are related by a linear equation,
âout = câ + sb̂† ,

(15.225)

where c and s are c-numbers and b̂† is a creation operator characterizing the amplifier.
Without loss of generality, it may be assumed that c and s are real. The commutator
of the field operators is invariant under unitary transformation U :
[âout , â†out ] = 1 = [â, â† ]

,

[âin , â†out ] = 0 = [âout , â†in ] .

(15.226)

From the unitarity of U , it follows that b̂ satisfies the same commutation relations.
The c-numbers are then c2 − s2 = 1. Hence, the phase-invariant amplifier acts by

534

CHAPTER 15. ATOMS IN QUANTIZED RADIATION FIELDS

introducing an additional mode to the field, with a large amount of stored energy,
behaving as a boson. Calculating the gain and the noise of this amplifier, one finds
G = c, and
noise = c2 − 1 .
(15.227)

The coefficient g = |G|2 is sometimes called the intensity amplification coefficient.
The noise of the linear phase-invariant amplifier is given by g − 1. The gain can be
dropped by splitting the beam; the estimate above gives the minimal possible noise of
the linear phase-invariant amplifier. The linear amplifier has an advantage over the
multi-mode amplifier: if several modes of a linear amplifier are amplified by the same
factor, the noise in each mode is determined independently;that is, modes in a linear
quantum amplifier are independent.
To obtain a large amplification coefficient with minimal noise, one may use homodyne detection, constructing a field state with known amplitude and phase, corresponding to the linear phase-invariant amplifier. The uncertainty principle sets the
lower bound of quantum noise in an amplifier. In particular, the output of a laser
system and the output of an optical generator are not coherent states.
The multiplicative amplifier D also adds additive noise F . We have DD† = 1,

Homodyne detection and inverse Radon transform

In the method of homodyne detection or phase-sensitive detection the signal is obtained
by superposing the field mode of interest with a local oscillator with a relative phase
θ at a beam splitter and a subtraction of the photo currents in the two ports of the
interferometer:
∆Jˆ = â†t ât − b̂†t b̂t

∆Jˆ = |αLO |(â0 e−ıθ + â†0 eıθ )
√
= 2|αLO |x̂θ ,

(15.230)

where the field mode is expressed by the Hermitian quadrature components â0 =
2−1/2 · (x̂θ + ıŷθ ). The expectation value of ∆Jˆ is afflicted with the Heisenberg
uncertainty and can be expressed as the first moment of the Wigner function W (α):

15.6. BEAM SPLITTING AND QUANTUM AMPLIFICATION

This is called the radon transform. The distribution function wθ (pθ ) as well as the
Wigner function are normalized to 1. Multiple measurements of the expectation value
xθ = hψ|x̂θR|ψi now yields a histogram H|ψi (xθ ) reflecting, if normalized, w|ψi (xθ ) =
H|ψi (xθ )/ H|ψi (xθ ) exactly the distribution function.
Considering the finite detector efficiency [383] wθ (xθ ) must be generalized to a

A finite detector efficiency degrades the contrast of the quantum interference structures.
With the procedure of optical homodyne tomography or quantum state endoscopy
the Wigner function for e.g. a Schrödinger
cat state can be reconstructed from a set
R
of distribution functions wθ (xθ ) = W (αeıθ )dpθ measured for various phases θ [383].
To do this the data set is exposed to an inverse radon transform:

In contrast to the conventional homodyne detection, where the phase dependency of
amplitude noise is recorded, the homodyne tomography allows the complete reconstruction of a quantum state through measurement of the distribution of the amplitude

Alternatively, to the homodyne method, one may reconstruct the photon distribution in field modes from their temporal evolution [635]. Another method could be
to use atoms as sensors for the quantum state of a light field in a Jaynes-Cummings
type dynamics.

Quantum measurement
Since its foundation, the theory of quantum mechanics was driven by the urge to
clarify the relationship between the world and what we can learn about it, that is, between reality and the observer. Scientists such as Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and
Einstein defended controversial positions and struggled for the correct interpretation
of quantum mechanics. The measurement process is supposed to provide information about the world out there, but it is not clear whether this information can be
complete and accurate, or whether there are limitations or hidden variables. Also, it
was unclear, to what extend a measurement can be non-invasive or whether it would
always perturb the phenomenon under investigation. The most important step in
this question was the Copenhagen interpretation formulated by Bohr, Heisenberg and
Born in 1927 and elaborated later by von Neumann and Dirac. Although contested
many times in the past, it’s essence still remains valid today.
In this chapter we will study the measurement process from the viewpoint quantum mechanics and discuss some seemingly paradoxical effects, that will allow us to
deepen our understanding. Among them are the quantum jump, Schrödinger’s cat,
the quantum Zeno effect, and the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox.

16.1

The observer and the reality

According to the Copenhagen interpretation, theoretical predictions have a probabilistic character. However, this is not an expression of the imperfection of the theory, but
of the intrinsically indeterministic character of quantum processes 1 . Moreover, the
Copenhagen interpretation desists to attribute to objects of the quantum formalism,
such as wavefunctions and operators, an immediate reality. Instead, the objects of
the formalism only represent vehicles for a probabilistic prediction of the results of
measurements. These results are only truly real elements of quantum theory. It is obvious, that the quantum theory and its interpretations are of fundamental importance
to the scientific view of the world and our concept of nature.

16.1.1

Schrödinger’s cat

In the microscopic world, the relationship between the sample and the observer is very
delicate. And this delicacy is at the origin of quantum effects that seem paradoxical
1 Note that it is problematic to identify unpredictability and indeterminism. We may be unable
to predict specific events, without having to assume that these events occur in a random manner.

CHAPTER 16. QUANTUM MEASUREMENT

through our classical concept of the world. It is, thus, not surprising that one of
the most fascinating areas of investigations is the interface between the classical
and the quantum, the macroscopic and the microscopic worlds. For the pioneers of
quantum mechanics the most important questions were of the type: ’How is it possible
that a microscopic particle flies simultaneously through two slits?’ Nowadays, we
are accustomed to such paradoxes, and we simply accept the fact that we have to
consider a particle as a wave. Nevertheless, we still do not understand very well,
why the classical and the quantum world behave so differently. ’Why does quantum
mechanics allow for quantum superpositions states, which are absolutely forbidden in
classical physics?’, ’Why are the fundamental laws of the quantum world invariant to
the arrow of time, while the macroscopic world always evolves from the past to the
future?, ’How can it be that quantum mechanics allows for effects having no cause,
like spontaneous emission, while the everyday world seems to be deterministic?’

Figure 16.1: Double slit.

Quantum mechanics must, in some limit, clearly encompass classical physics. But
in spite of Ehrenfest’s correspondence principle, this fact is far from being trivial.
Some predictions of classical and quantum physics are fundamentally different and,
in some cases, even contradictory. The famous Schrödinger cat states are the epitome
of this fact: In one version of this paradox, a particle crosses a double slit. Behind
one of the slits is a detector which, as soon as it registers a particle, actuates a device
killing a cat. We know that in quantum reality the particle crosses both slits in a
superposition state, so that the cat should be in a superposition state as well. Hence,
quantum cats can be in a superposition of ’dead’ and ’alive’.
We believe nowadays that the answers to the above questions are somehow buried
in processes that destroy the quantum superposition of Schrödinger cats during the
transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic world. However, the details of
these quantum coherence destruction processes, called decoherence, are very compli-

cated and the subject of serious efforts in contemporary research. It is one of the motivations for trying to create in laboratories the largest possible (quasi-macroscopic)
quantum systems, bring them in Schrödinger cat-like superposition states and study
their decoherence 2 .
16.1.1.1

Quantum measurement

Every unperturbed system follows the Schrödinger equation. Once its Hamiltonian
has been determined, the formal solution,
|ψi = e−ıĤt/~ |ψ0 i ,

(16.1)

allows to calculate the time evolution, that is, the trajectory of the wavefunction. The
evolution is coherent and reversible in time.
Now, the process of measuring a pure quantum state includes –according the
Copenhagen interpretation and as discussed in Sec. 2.2.7– two consecutive steps: In
the first step, the interaction of the quantum sample with the measuring device (which
from now on we will call meter) destroys all coherences and projects the pure state
into a statistical mixture of eigenstates of the meter. Following von Neumann, the
impact of the meter on the quantum system is so strong, that its coherent evolution
is interrupted and it is projected onto the degree of freedom that the apparatus
wants to measure, e.g. its position or its momentum, but not both in the same time.
The projection transforms a pure quantum state |ψi into a statistical mixture ρ of
eigenstates,
X
ρ̂sample = |ψ(t)ihψ(t)| y ρ̂proj =
|hψ|ki|2 |kihk| .
(16.2)
k

This process is irreversible, that is, it separates the past from the future. The projection is not described by the Schrödinger equation. Instead, the sudden reduction of
the state must be postulated, as done by von Neumann’s famous axiom.
In a second step, the observer looks at the measuring device and confirms one of
the possible results. Thus, he transforms the state into a eigenstate of the device 3 :
ρ̂proj y ρ̂meter = |kihk| .

(16.3)

2 There are attempts to introduce the concept of the time arrow also in the microscopic world:
’In an isolated system, spontaneous processes occur in the direction of increasing entropy.’ [431].
3 We note that, only if all commuting observables of the system are measured and acknowledged,
ρ̂meter becomes a pure state. Otherwise ρmeter remains a partial mixture.

544

CHAPTER 16. QUANTUM MEASUREMENT

From this moment, we can again leave the quantum system alone until the next
measure.
From the viewpoint of the quantum system, the evolution of the measurement
process appears discontinuous, because it destroys all possible coherences between its
states. In fact, the problem comes from the non-ideal behavior of the measuring device
(symbolized by | ↑i before the measurement). An ideal non-invasive measurement 4
would leave the quantum state |ψi unchanged:
H

|ψi| ↑i −→ |ψi| %i ,

(16.4)

while the measuring device changes to a state (| %i after the measurement) indicating
the current state of the system. However, this is normally impossible without previously established correlation between |ψi and | ↑i. In a real meter device, the coupling
between |ψi and | ↑i requires that the meter and the system to be non-orthogonal.
16.1.1.2

Measurement-induced decoherence

A more modern view of the quantum measurement is the following: When the outer
world (called reservoir, observer or meter) reads a quantum system, it causes, due to
this transfer of information, an irreversible demolition of coherence. Consequently,
the density operator condenses to its diagonal. On the other hand, the system as a
whole (including the sample and the reservoir) always evolves coherently according
to the von Neumann equation with the Hamiltonian of everything Ĥall :
ı
ρ̂˙ = [ρ̂, Ĥall ] .
~

(16.5)

If Ĥsample is the small quantum system under investigation, a complete description
of the measurement process requires the inclusion of the observer, that is, the total
Hamiltonian is,

Ĥ = Ĥsample ⊗ Ĥmeter =

(16.6)

Ideally, the system evolves independently without being disturbed by the meter. Unfortunately, this also means that the meter evolves independently, that is, it is not
influenced by the system and thus does not provide information about the system.
To allow a transfer of information, we need to couple the respective spaces by an
interaction Ω, such that,

Figure 16.3: Spontaneous emission can be seen as a coupling of the system under investigation to an external meter, because it delivers information to the meter, even if only to tell
us: ’The system was in an excited state, but now it’s in a ground state.’

Example 71 (Quantum measurement in a two-qubit system): To discuss
this at an example, we consider the simplest imaginable system: Two two-level
atoms, the first one representing the quantum system under investigation and
the second the meter. We introduce the following basis:

The discussion about the correct interpretation of the measurement process is still
ongoing. Modern theories describe the state reduction in terms of quantum decoherence due to interactions of the system with the environment. Other interpretations
involve decoherent histories or assume multiple worlds [481]. On the practical side,
the current interest in quantum decoherence is motivated by the fact that this phenomenon may turn out to be the fundamental factor limiting the useful operation
of quantum computers. Another interesting area where quantum mechanics meets
classical physics is the phenomenon of quantum chaos.

16.1.2

The quantum jump

Obviously, the whole quantum measurement process, including the discontinuity of
the state projection, could be fully understood within a grand model of the complete
system, which would include the measuring device. In practice, this is illusory, because
of the excessive number of degrees of freedom of the classical measuring device (e.g. a
Schrödinger cat).
On the other hand, many characteristics of quantum measurement can be illustrated in a simple three-level atom with a weak transition representing the quantum
sample and a strong transition representing the meter. The assertion defended in

the following is, that this three-level system, called quantum amplifier, gives a deep
insight into what happens during the process of state reduction and, therefore, can
be considered as paradigmatic for theories on quantum measurement.
To be able to discuss the dynamics of this system on a firmer ground, we will first
introduce the quantum Monte Carlo wavefunction simulation method (MCWF).
16.1.2.1

Quantum Monte-Carlo wavefunction simulation of a two-level
system

The possible occurrence of spontaneous emission produces a dynamics called quantum
trajectory, which can be described by a non-hermitian effective Hamiltonian,

is that, for being non-hermitian, [Ĥef f , Ĥef

dynamics, e−ıĤef f t 6= eıĤef f t . This means that the mere possibility of spontaneous
emission prevents the reversibility of the dynamics. We observe a temporal decrease
of the norm hψ(t)|ψ(t)i indicating a loss of energy,
hψ|ψi = hψ0 |e−ıĤt eıĤt |ψ0 i −→ e−Γt .

(16.10)

The loss of normalization during the evolution, until the next quantum jump occurs,
is due to the dissipation of energy toward the reservoir,

and represents a measure of the probability that an irreversible process has occurred

Dissipative processes can be simulated by playing dices with random numbers ζ.
We divide time into small intervals dt and propagate the wavefunction from ψ(t)
to ψ(t + dt). After each interval we evaluate the probability p = 1 − hψ(t)|ψ(t)i

accumulated during the time period [0, t + dt] that a dissipative process (such as
spontaneous emission) has occurred. Now, we generate a random number ζ, uniformly
distributed between 0 and 1, which we compare to probability the probability p. In
case, ζ > 1 − hψ(t)|ψ(t)i, we conclude that there was no dissipative process, and we
let the system proceed in peace, only renormalizing the wavefunction to compensate
for the losses [429, ?]. Otherwise, if ζ < 1 − hψ(t)|ψ(t)i, we conclude that there
was a dissipative process, and the system is projected into the eigenstate ψ0 . This
projection is abrupt and called quantum jump. Now, the evolution restarts from zero,
ruled by the effective Hamiltonian. The simulation implemented via,

to be aware, that a trajectory generated by a MCWF simulation (16.12) only represents

ρ(t) = |ψ(t)ihψ(t)| (blue curve) is nothing else, than the average (black curve) over all
possible MCWF trajectories for the system. A movie of this simulation can be watched here
(watch movie).

The effective two-level Hamiltonian (16.9) dissipates via spontaneous emission,
which is included in the dynamics through the possibility for the system to suffer a
state reduction. The modification of |ψ(t)i by non-observation of spontaneous emission, reduces the population of the state excited by 1 − 21 Γdt, while the ground state
population remains unchanged. Every quantum jump projecting the system into the
ground state constitutes a measurement, because it corresponds to a detected fluorescence photon.
16.1.2.2

Three-level systems: The epitome of quantum measurement

Let us now return to the mysterious interaction between the sample and the meter,
which we want to unravel by comparing two possible procedures: 1. treating the
sample and the meter separately and explain the extraction of information following
the von Neumann postulate; 2. treating the sample and the meter by a global theory.

548

CHAPTER 16. QUANTUM MEASUREMENT

As said above, the inclusion of the meter in a global theory is, in general, difficult.
For this reason, to perform the comparison, we choose the simplest imaginable system:
the three-level system with two transitions connecting to a common ground state and
excited by radiation fields. As shown in Fig. 16.6(a) this three-level system can be
an atom with a strong transition and a weak transition, for example, the dipolar
transition S1/2 − P1/2 and the forbidden quadrupolar transition S1/2 − D5/2 in a
single Ba+ ion. We will now name the ’strong transition’ as meter and the ’weak
transition’ as sample and show that this system allows to study the von Neumann
measurement process including the direct observation of quantum jumps 5 . At the
same time, the system is simple enough for a complete theoretical description. In this
sense, the three-level system becomes the epitome of a quantum measurement device.
We turn our attention to the three-level atom: Obviously, the atom will preferentially scatters photons on its strong dipolar transition. However, at times when
the valence electron is ’shelved’ in the metastable state excited by the quadrupole
transition, no fluorescence can be observed on the strong transition.

Figure 16.6: (a) Quantum measurement at the example of a three-level atom incorporating
a weak (sample) transition and a strong (meter) transition. (b) Random Telegraph signal in
the resonance fluorescence due to quantum jumps.

Quantum jumps were experimentally observed in single trapped ions, whose lowest
energies form a three-level systems [460, 546, 547, 58].
16.1.2.3

Quantum Monte-Carlo wavefunction simulation of the quantum
amplifier

When both lasers driving the weak and the strong transition are irradiated simultaneously, the coherence on the weak transition is easily perturbed by the dynamics of
the strong transition. To resolve this problem Dehmelt invented what he called the
quantum amplifier. The idea consists in alternately irradiating the sample laser (at
stage S − D in Fig. 16.7) and the meter laser (at stage S − P in Fig. 16.7) 6 .
5 The observability of quantum jumps as manifestations of sudden state reductions has been the
object of long-standing debates: ’If we have to go on with these damned quantum jumps, then I’m
sorry that I ever got involved with quantum mechanics.’ [558].
6 The absence of the ’meter’ laser during the ’sample’ stage avoids saturation broadening and
light-shifts of the ground state. Since the ground state is shared by both transitions, its broadening
would reduce the spectral overlap between the ’sample’ transition and the driving laser and therefore
the probability to excite the metastable level. This inhibition of the coherent dynamic by too strong
or too frequent measurements is known as quantum Zeno effect: The more an observer tries to

16.1. THE OBSERVER AND THE REALITY

549

The alternating irradiation of the lasers S − D and S − P can also be treated by
the Monte Carlo quantum wavefunction simulation method (16.12) using the effective
Hamiltonian,

where the Rabi frequencies Ωsd and Ωsd are switched on alternately.
In the simulation 16.7 the quantum jumps to the shelved metastable state D5/2
appear as long periods without population in the P1/2 level (first period S − P , where
the population of S1/2 , illustrated by the red curve, gradually tends to 0 for long
times). The reduction of the system to the shelved state actually occurs by nonobservation of fluorescence on the strong transition. The projection needs a finite
time, simply because we can not be sure whether the non-observation is actually due
to shelving or the incidental absence of scattering events on the S − P transition:
After all, it is not predictable, when the next photon will be spontaneously emitted,
even though the lifetime of the excited state is short. But for longer observation times
it becomes increasingly unlikely that the absence of photons is not due to shelving. It
is this unlikeliness, which lets the population rapidly converge towards the metastable
state. In the second S − P period, Fig. 16.7 shows fast transitions to the P1/2 followed by sudden decays to the ground state. These processes correspond to photon
absorption and spontaneous reemission by the strong transition. The succession of
the photon scattering events is so fast, that the signal recorded by photodetectors
appears as a continuous fluorescence. The sudden transitions between bright and
dark periods shown in Fig. 16.6(b), which occur totally randomly, are interpreted as
quantum jumps.
16.1.2.4

Comparison with Bloch equations and interpretation of quantum
jumps

We already mentioned in Fig. 16.5, that a trajectory generated by a MCWF simulation
(16.12) represents one possible evolution of the system. In Chp. 14.6.1 we got to know
an alternative way of predicting the evolution of a system, based on density operator
obeying a master equation, which in the context of atomic excitation levels is called
Bloch equation. Comparing MCWF trajectories (red curves in Fig. 16.7) with Bloch
vector evolutions (green curves) it becomes apparent, that the Bloch vector evolution
does not produce quantum jumps, but is always smooth and continuous.
In most cases, our knowledge about the actual state of an atom comes from the
collection of spontaneously emitted photons. The observation of a photon projects
the atomic state into the ground state. However, this concept is not included in the
Bloch equations, as we just saw in Fig. 16.7. So, as it seems, we have to take back our
statement, that the three-level Bloch equation describe the complete system, although
they somehow contain spontaneous emission.
Let us go one step back and ask, where the Bloch equations came from. In fact,
as we learned in Sec. 15.4 and will deepen in Sec. 16.2, they are derived from a
von Neumann equation for the three-level system plus the degrees of freedom of the
extract information from a system, the more he inhibits its evolution. We will discuss this effect in
more detail in Sec. 28.5.2.1.

vacuum modes receiving the spontaneously emitted photons by tracing over the latter
ones.
We will not be able to handle all degrees of freedom. However, we can generalize
the Bloch equations in the following way [440, 679]. We project the total density
operator ρAF R of the atom plus the driving field plus the reservoir of vacuum modes
into the subspace of the atom and the driving field consisting of exactly n photons,
ρ(n) = TrR (P (n) ρAF R ) ,

(16.14)

and derive, from the von Neumann equation, the master equation for the atomic state
ρ(n) under the constraint of a fixed number of photons n in the field. The master
equation differs only in one term from the usual Bloch equations: The expression
(n)
Γ12 ρ22 , which describes the spontaneous decay of the population of the excited state
(n−1)
of the meter transition, is replaced by the expression Γ12 ρ22 :

P (n)
The substate with of n photons violates the trace condition,
j ρjj 6= 1. The
physical explanation for this is the following: While induced emission and absorption
maintain the number of photons in the combined light-atom system (like in the JaynesCummings model), spontaneous emission decreases the number of photons, leading
to an irreversible loss of energy. The quantum jump observed in MCWF model

16.1. THE OBSERVER AND THE REALITY

551

corresponds, in the modified equations (16.15), to a collapse of the subspace described
by ρ(n) with the time constant Γ12 and a birth of another subspace ρ(n−1) , whose
evolution is guided by another (analogous) Bloch equation, now for n − 1 photons.
Each fluorescence detection at time t = 0 determines the initial condition for the
future development of the system: ρ(n) (0) = 0 and ρ(n−1) (0) = |1ih1|. The probability
density c(t) for a new observation of spontaneous emission at time t with detection

Kraus operator for position measurement

As a canonical example of a Kraus operator [40, 109] we take Ĥ = x̂ ⊗ p̂, where the
position and the momentum satisfy the commutation relation, [x̂, p̂] = i. The initial
state of the ancilla be a Gaussian distribution,
|φi =

The position wavefunction of the ancilla is,
φ(q) = hq|φi =

The Kraus operators are (compared to the previous discussion, we now let λ = 1),
M (q) = hq|e−ıx̂⊗p̂ |φi =

since the operator e−ıx̂⊗p̂ makes a spatial translation when applied to the degree of

E(q) = Mq† Mq = √

which obey dqE(q) = I.

Note that limσ→0 E(q) = |x = qihx = q|. That is, in a particular limit, these
operators converge to a strong measurement of position. For σ → ∞, we speak of
weak measurement.
Another example would be the three-level atom of Dehmelt’s quantum amplifier.

Exercises
Ex: Dispersive quantum jumps

Consider a three-level system in V-configuration, as depicted in Fig. 14.6(b), with an
unstable state |1i, a ground state 2i, and a metastable state |3i. Discuss whether the
atom shelved in state |3i is sensitive to light-shift and power broadened induced by
a laser resonant to the |1i − |2i transition. E.g. will power-broadening only effect the
transition rate |1i −→ |3i or also |3i −→ |1i?

16.2

Open systems and the master equation

Let us now derive the master equation for an open quantum system. We assume that
the environment (also called bath or reservoir ) and the system under consideration are
quantum systems in the sense that (1) the relevant degrees of freedom are completely
characterized by state vectors (or density matrices), and (2) the temporal evolution
of the total system is unitary U (t) = e−iĤt . The total Hamiltonian, Ĥ = Ĥsys +
Ĥres + V is assumed to be independent of time and consists of three parts, namely
the Hamiltonian of the system Ĥsys , the Hamiltonian of the bath Ĥres , and the
interaction V between the system and the bath. The purpose of the master equation
is to find the dynamics of the system by tracing over all degrees of freedom of the bath.
This is not always possible, and we will assume that the interaction V is sufficiently
weak, so that perturbation theory is applicable.
In the interaction representation the evolution of the total density matrix ρ̂tot
becomes,
dρ̃tot
= [Ṽ (t), ρ̃tot ] .
i~
(16.21)
dt
where ρ̃tot (t) ≡ U0† ρtot U0 and Ṽ (t) ≡ U0† V U0 and U0 = e−ı(Ĥsys +Ĥres )t/~ . This
evolution is, for the time being, very general, and the solution can be formally written,
Z

In the following, we will call several approximations to simplify the calculations, in
particular, the Born approximation, the assumption that the initial state is a product
state and, later-on, the Markov approximation.

16.2.1

Born approximation for weak coupling

We will now assume the interaction Ṽ to be weak. We can then expect that, repeating
the iterative process, the series will converge and write the general solution as,

16.2. OPEN SYSTEMS AND THE MASTER EQUATION

553

This way of terminating an iterative equation by ρtot (0) is generally known as the
Born approximation. Here, we will just go to second order in Ṽ . Tracing over the
bath,
ρ̃sys (t) = Trres ρ̃tot (t) ,
(16.25)
we extract the density matrix for only the system,

16.2.2

Assumption of an initial product state

Next, we need to make the quite important assumption, that the initial state between
the system and the environment are not correlated, or mathematically speaking, they
can be written as product states,
ρ̃tot (0) = ρ̃sys (0) ⊗ ρres (0) .

(16.27)

Another assumption, which is not essential but often valid, is that Trres [Ṽ (t1 ), ρ̃tot (0)] =
0. If this is the case, then the first-order term will vanish. In second order, we can
write,
ρ̃sys (t) = eM(t) ρ̃sys (0)
where

The superoperator L is called Lindbladt operator.

16.2.3

Markov approximation for short memory

Here, we have to evaluate the terms involving the average with respect to the thermal
bath, which is assumed to have a short memory, in the sense that the correlation time
is very short. Mathematically,

In other words, the two-point correlation function is significant only, when t ' τ , and
it is valid to extend the upper bound to infinity. This is the Markov approximation.

The quantum Zeno effect

A famous problem raised by the Greek philosopher (490-430 AC)Zeno goes like this:
Achilles and a turtle organize a race. The arrogant Achilles leaves a 100-meter lead
to the turtle. The race begins. Achilles soon covers the 100 meters, only to find out
that meanwhile the turtle has advanced by 10 meters. He continues running to cover
the 10 meters, only to find out that meanwhile the turtle has advanced by 1 meter,
and so on 7 . A presentation on the subject is available at (watch talk).
Interestingly, Zeno’s problem has a counterpart in quantum mechanics. Let us do
the following Gedankenexperiment: A laser beam passes through a dense series of n

polarizers, each one being rotated by an angle 2n
7 In

another version of his paradox, Zeno questions the possibility of motion at the example of a
flying arrow: At any instant of time it occupies a space equal to its size. That is, at any particular
moment of its flight, it is at rest, in a space that does not move. That is, any kind of motion is
impossible. Nowadays, we know that this paradox is false, because time and motion are not discrete.
But this can only be understood on the basis of infinitesimal calculus [435].

The temporal evolution of the wavefunction of a system described by the Hamiltonian Ĥ is |ψ(t)i = e−iĤt/~ |ψ0 i. We can then calculate the amplitude and probability
for the system to stay in the initial state,
hψ0 |ψ(t)i = hψ0 |e−ıĤt/~ |ψ0 i

and

P (t) = |hψ0 |ψ(t)i|2 .

For short times we can expand,
hψ0 |ψ(δt)i = |ψ0 i −

In this way we can extract the Zeno time from the above equations, τZ = ~2 / hĤ 2 i0 − hĤi20 .
We now make N successive von Neumann measurements within a time t, which leads
to a measurement frequency of τ −1 . The measurements are conceived as to verify,
whether the system is still in its initial state, but each measurement projects our
system back to its initial state, from where it has to start the transition process from
scratch. Under these conditions, the population of the initial state will evolve like,
and

P (δt) ' 1−

P (N ) (τ ) = P (N ) (t/N )N .

(16.43)

8 An analogous experiment can be imagined by a series of Stern-Gerlach measurements of the spin
of an atom.
9 The quantum Zeno effect was often used to justify the physical relevance of the state reduction
postulate. It was shown, however, that this postulate is not essential for understanding the quantum
Zeno effect [47]. The effect already follows directly from the Schrödinger equation and therefore
has a purely dynamical nature. This shows that the projection is a purely mathematical construct
without physical reality (see Sec. 16.1.2).

about the correct interpretation of this effect and its relationship to trivial power
broadening is not closed. Some works have even proposed the possibility of an antiZeno effect [?, 9, 632], where observation would accelerate the evolution of the system.
Currently the quantum Zeno effect is also studied for possible applications in metrology, computation, and quantum information [353].
When the quantum Zeno effect was proposed for the first time, it was considered
a paradox: How could an unstable particle never decay, just by being continually
observed? And what would happen to Schrödinger’s cat, whose live depends on state

b. If N measurements are performed during a time t, we have the time interval

after N measurements, the probability of the system remaining in the initial state is
given by [P (T )]N . Show that for an infinite number of measurements, N → ∞, the
system remains in the initial state without loss of probability: [P (T )]N = 1. Interpret

The Elitzur and Vaidman bomb testing problem



Mixing the concepts of particles and waves we sometimes arrive at seemingly paradoxical conclusions. One example is Elitzur and Vaidman’s bomb testing problem.
They imagined a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the particularity that the reflecting mirror of one of the arms be connected to a device measuring the photonic
recoil. That is, when a photon passes through this arm, the mirror undergoes a small
acceleration, which is sufficient to activate an explosive bomb.
Now, we distinguish two cases: 1. The recoil detector does not work, i.e. the bomb
is not armed. 2. The bomb is armed. We now adjust the interferometer in a way
to produce destructive interference in one of the two interferometer output ports. If,
having sent many photons through the interferometer, we never saw any photons in
the ’dark’ port, we can be almost sure that the bomb is not operational.

In case the bomb is operational, the observation of a photonic recoil destroys
the interference pattern at the interferometer outputs. It has to do so, because the
exploding bomb informs us, in which arm the photon has passed. However, with an
operational bomb the interference pattern is also destroyed, when the photon passes
through the other arm, since the fact that the bomb didn’t explode tells us, that the
photon went the other way.
The funny conclusion is now, that it may happen, that a photon traverses the
interferometer in the arm that does not contain the bomb and exits through the
’dark port’. The probability of this happening is only 25%, but nevertheless the
observation of a photon in the ’dark port’ informs to us that the pump is operative
without ever having interacted with it 10 .

Noisy measures

16.5.1

Quantum projection noise

The intrinsic indeterminism of quantum mechanics has serious consequences for metrology. To show this, we consider the example of a system of two levels |1i and |2i. This
system can be in a superposition state |ψi. The probability 11 to find the system in
one of the two states |ii is pi = hP̂i i = |hψ|ii|2 , where P̂i is the projection operator.
The result of a measurement of the population is afflicted by an inherent uncertainty
expressed by the variance (∆pi )2 = pi (1 − pi ). In other words, the random projection of the system on the eigenstate basis induces a noise called quantum projection
noise 12 This noise inhibits the determination of the probabilities pi in a single measurement. On the other hand, by measuring populations on a sample of n atoms or
by repeating the measurement n times with a single atom under identical conditions,
we can reduce the uncertainty. The probability of finding an atom r times in the state
|2i is,

same results.
12 Projection noise can be interpreted as shot noise. However, the optical shot noise in photodetectors is generated by the repartition of the field energy into discrete photons, the projection noise
is the consequence of the discretization of the electronic excitation levels.

When we increase the number of measurements, n →
p ∞, this function condenses
around a narrow peak at the position Gt = 2 arcsin r/n. The width of the peak
evolves like 2 arccos(2−1/2n ).
In summary, even for perfectly efficient population measurements (e.g. using the
microwave-optical double resonance method) it is impossible to measure the probability p2 with a single atom in a single experiment. As such an observation only admits
two possible results, ’fluorescence observed’ or ’fluorescence not observed’, i.e. ρ2 2 = 1
or ρ2 2 = 0, a whole range of possible populations between 0 and 1 is excluded. Therefore, a single observation only provides ’partial’ information, which can be gradually
improved with each consecutive observation.
A presentation on this topic is available here (watch talk).

Ramsey experiments

The Ramsey experiment is basically equivalent to the Rabi experiment described
above except for an additional rotation in configuration space allowing for the measurement of the phase precession of the coherence between the Ramsey pulses via
population spectroscopy. The Ramsey fringes are approximated by p2 = 0.5(1 +
cos[(ω − ω0 )T ]). The interesting magnitude is the frequency uncertainty,

Geometric and topological phases

We consider a Hamiltonian Ĥ(R(t)), which only depends implicitly on time, that is,
via some time-dependent parameter R(t). Then the Hamiltonian evolves by developing a non-measurable dynamic phase and additionally accumulates a geometric phase
(also called topological phase or Berry phase. This geometric phase, which depends
on the trajectory, is adiabatically followed in parameter space. Let us consider the
time-evolution of a state |ψ(t)i [60],
Ĥ|ψ(t)i = ı~∂t |ψ(t)i ,

(16.49)

assuming that at any instant of time the system stays in a eigenstate |n(R)i,
Ĥ|n(R)i = En (R)|n(R)i .

that, while the first exponential describes the standard dynamical phase, the phase
γn : C → γn (C) is not integrable, i.e. γn cannot be expressed as a function of R(t) and
is not single-valued meaning that from R(T ) = R(0) we cannot infer γn (T ) = γn (0).

Properties of the Berry phase

16.6.1.1

Gauge invariance

We have seen in 2.5.3 that the gauge transformation (2.198), Ucl (ξ) = e−ıξ(R) , leaves
the Schrödinger equation invariant. Applied to an eigenstate,
|ñ(R)i = e−ıξ(R) |n(R)i ,

(16.56)

the Berry connection becomes,

Z
γ̃n (C) = γn (C) +
∇R ξ · dR = γn (C) + ξ(t) − ξ(0) .
(16.58)
C

For a closed loop, continuity of the gauge field requires ξ(T ) − ξ(0) = 2πm. Hence, up
to an integer multiple of 2π, closed loop Berry phases remain gauge-invariant under
arbitrary gauge transformation and may be related to physical observables.

Berry curvature

It is often advantageous to convert the path integral (16.55) into a surface integral
using Stokes’ theorem. Defining the Berry curvature as,

we obtain,

16.6.1.3

Generalization of the Berry phase according to Aharonov

We will now drop the conditions imposed to the Hamiltonian with regard to its
adiabatic behavior and request that the state must be a eigenstate [122]:
Ĥ|ψ(t)i = ı~|ψ̇(t)i .

(16.62)

A process is cyclic, when there is a τ , such that,
|ψ(τ i = eı[f (τ )−f (0)] |ψ(0)i .

(16.63)

Defining the space of radii by |ψ̃(t)i = e−ıf (t) |ψ(t)i, we obtain,
|ψ̃(τ )i = |ψ̃(0)i ,

(16.64)

and from the Schrödinger equation we obtain,

The dynamic phase δ can be zeroed by an appropriate choice of Ĥ(t), but not the
topological phase β. β does not depend on Ĥ(t), but is a geometric property of the
curve, which projects H onto P. In contrast to eıβ , the phase β is only determined
modulo 2πn.

Aharonov-Bohm effect

A particular case for topological phases is the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which we will
discuss in the following. The only observables of electromagnetism are the forces of
Coulomb and Lorentz which, in the theory of electrodynamics, are described by electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic potentials can be introduced to simplify
calculations, but they are not observables with a physical reality. In contrast, in
quantum mechanics, electromagnetic potentials are more fundamental than electromagnetic fields. This is demonstrated by the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Figure 16.10: (a) Scheme for measuring the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The electrons propagate as wavepackets whose centers-of-mass are not subject to forces, but whose de Broglie
waves are phase-shifted by the vector potential. (b) Aharonov-Casher effect: the electrodes
Φ do not produce electric fields inside the conductors; even so, one observes constructive
or destructive interference at the output of the interferometer, depending on the applied
potential.

The idea of this effect is schematized in Fig. 16.10. An electron beam is coherently
divided into two arms (e.g. by a double slit) passing both sides of an infinitely extended
~ vanishes in the region
and perfectly shielded solenoid. In this way the magnetic field B
outside the solenoid, but there must exist nonetheless a potential vector A, because
we observe on the screen an interference pattern of the two arms of the electronic
interferometer. When pass a current through the solenoid, we observe a displacement
of the interference pattern.
16.6.2.1

Aharonov-Bohm effect and gauge transformation

Let R and S be two disconnected spatial regions. Suppose that the electric and
magnetic fields are kept zero in region R. Then, it is classically impossible to measure
some change in the dynamics of a body confined to the region R resulting from a
change of the magnetic field confined to the region S. The Aharonov-Bohm effect
shows that the opposite is true: Electrons in the magnetic field-free region R do sense
magnetic field fluxes in a region S, despite the regions R and S having no intersection!
In the classical theory of electromagnetism, in a region of empty space (except for
~ t) and magnetic fields B(r,
~ t)
electric charges and electric currents), the electric E(r,
are related to the electric charge ρ(r, t) and current densities j(r, t) according to the
Maxwell equations. When we know for a spatial region the sources ρ and j and the

566

CHAPTER 16. QUANTUM MEASUREMENT

~ must fulfill, we can determine the fields
boundary conditions that the fields E~ and B
as solutions of Maxwell’s system of partial differential equations.
In classical electrodynamics, observed from some inertial frame, the electromagnetic force Fem acting on a point-like body with charge q, at position r, and with
velocity v, is given by the Lorentz force:
~
~
Fem (r(t), t) = q E(r(t),
t) + qv(t) × B(r(t),
t) .

(16.67)

Electrodynamic theory affirms the existence of two functions Φ(r, t) and A(r, t), such
that,
~ t) = ∇ × A(r, t)
B(r,

and

~ t) = −∇Φ(r, t) − ∂A(r, t) .
E(r,
∂t

(16.68)

Thus, we can use the equations (16.68) to rewrite the Maxwell equations.
The so-defined potentials Φ and A are not unique, but any Φ and A leading to the
~ and thus to the same physics, are equivalent. We will, however,
same fields E~ and B,
fix Φ and A adopting an additional condition that must be obeyed, i.e. we will adopt
a particular gauge. For the discussion of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, we will adopt
the Lorentz gauge defined by,
∇ · A(r, t) +

1 ∂Φ(r, t)
=0,
c2 ∂t

(16.69)

where c is the propagation velocity of light in vacuum.

Equation for quantum particle exposed to a vector potential A

Assume a particle (without spin) of mass m and charge q, whose wavefunction is
~ but
confined to a region R (connected by paths). We demand Φ = 0 and E~ = 0 = B,
we let A 6= 0, that is, ∇ × A(r, t) = 0. Note that along with (16.68) this forces A to
be stationary. According to quantum mechanics the wavefunction Ψ of the particle
must obey the following Schrödinger equation:

we can define the following scalar field:

corresponds to the gauge transform (2.198) and, given the condition (2.197), satisfies
the same Schrödinger equation as Ψ(r, t). We showed this explicitly in Exc. 16.6.3.3.
Thus, the presence of a potential vector in the region R, even in the absence of
fields, causes a phase shift eıg(r) of the wavefunction. An interesting issue studied in
Exc. 16.6.3.4 is, whether this implies that the freedom of choice of the gauge field is
lost.
Example 74 (Observation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect): Imagine an
electron beam passing through a double-slit, as shown in Fig. 16.10(a). The
electronic wavefunction diffracts through both slits, which produces an interference pattern on a subsequent screen. Now, just after the double-slit, in the
shade of the region separating the two slits, we place an ideal infinitely long
solenoid traversed on its axis by a constant, however, adjustable flux of magnetic field. The magnetic (and also the electric) field of the solenoid is confined
to a region S, and the confinement can be guaranteed, e.g. with layers of shielding materials, including superconductors. On the other hand, the wavefunctions
of the electrons are manifestly zero in this S region. In the R region, where the
electronic wavefunction may be non-zero, the fields are kept zero. R and S have
no overlap, both R and S are separately connected by paths.
We will show that the flux of the magnetic field in S can be measured through
the electronic dynamics in the region R, although the electron is never in the
region S, but confined to the field-free region R. This is the Aharonov-Bohm
(magnetic) effect.

a force, but causing a phase shift.

Entanglement and quantum
gates
The concept of entanglement arose in quantum mechanics by Einstein, Podolski and
Rosen’s famous Gedankenexperiment, today called the EPR paradox [199]. In his
Gedankenexperiment, Einstein tried to prove the necessity of hidden variables for
quantum mechanics to be a complete theory. Consequently, we begin this chapter by
introducing the notion of entangled particles and recapitulating the discussion of the
EPR paradox.
Since Feynman discovered the utility of entangled states for quantum computation
[483, 120], this area of research exploded with thousands of theoretical researchers, but
very few experimentalists, due to the enormous technical difficulties of creating and
controlling these states. On the other side, states of entangled photons already play
an important role in quantum cryptology [53]. And in the context of metrology, spinsqueezed correlated quantum states offer the possibility of quantum noise reduction
in frequency standards [654].
Among the various systems proposed for the realization of entangled states and
quantum computing gates we will only discuss one idea, which is based on the mutual
coupling of atoms through a Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction mediated by an optical
mode.

17.1

Quantum correlations and entanglement

17.1.1

The EPR paradox and GHZ states

Let us imagine two maximally correlated particles produced by a suitable source,
which fly freely without interaction in opposite directions along the z-axis toward two
detectors a and b. The particles have an internal degree of freedom (spin) |±ia,b ,
which can be measured in various directions, for example, x or y by operators σ̂xa,b
or σ̂ya,b . Since the particles are completely entangled, the result of a measurement on
the first particle σ̂xa allows the prediction of the result of another measurement σ̂xb
performed on the second particle, and similarly for σ̂ya and σ̂yb . Why is that?
The theory of hidden variables proposed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [199]
postulates, that the total state describing the two particles contains all information
about the way, how the particles should behave at the detectors. The information
was imprinted on each one of the two particle’s when they were created in the source,
571

(17.1)

where the notation should be read as a decision table.
On the other hand, quantum mechanics postulates that the reduction of the
wavepacket describing the particle at detector a decides spontaneously on the result of the measurement at detector b. This decision has no physical cause. If the
particles move with the speed of light, this decision is not restricted by local causality
[285]. The state can be given in the form,
|ψi = | +a +b i − | −a −b i .

(17.2)

Example 76 (Bell’s inequality ): Let us consider the EPR state (17.2). Particle ’a’ is embarked with Alice on a starship, while particle ’b’ flies with Bob in
opposite direction. Quantum mechanics tells us that, before any measurement,
the wavefunction is in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. After
some time, Alice measures her spin in z-direction. Let us assume her measurement collapses the wavefunction in the spin-up state (for z-direction). Doing
so, she instantaneously also collapses the wavefunction of Bob’s spin in spin-up
along the z-direction. Now, Bob tries to measure his spin in x-direction. If
he succeeds and finds spin-up in the x-direction, Alice’s wavefunction should
collapse in spin-up along the x-direction, as well. But according to quantum
mechanics, Alice should be unable to know the spin value in x-direction, since
the spin operator components do not commute with each other,
[σ̂za , σ̂xa ] = ı~σ̂ya

,

[σ̂zb , σ̂xb ] = ı~σ̂yb .

(17.3)

That is, the direction of measurement in Alice’s experiment fixes the quantization axis for Bob’s experiment.
Two hypotheses have been put forward: The first one is that Alice’s experiment
sends information to Bob’s experiment. Alice’s particle told Bob’s particle which
spin state he should be in. But this hypothesis violates the locality requirement
of special relativity claiming that information cannot travel faster than light.
Einstein called it ’spooky action at a distance’. The second hypothesis is to
assume that quantum mechanics does not violate locality, but that the particles carry with them ’local hidden variables’ (like a proper DNA) whose values
would be set right from the moment of the separation of the particles and which
would determine the outcomes of any future spin measurement. Then, quantum
mechanics would not be a complete theory, because it has nothing to say about
these hidden variables.
In 1964 John S. Bell suggested an experimental test for the EPR paradox. He
proposed a theorem formulated as an inequality, the famous Bell’s inequality,
stating that if the hidden variables hypothesis proposed by Einstein is correct,
then the inequality must be satisfied by experiment.
There are many versions of Bell’s inequality, all of them are equivalent. Let us
consider the Wigner-d’Espagnat version,
P (k+, n+) ≤ P (k+, m+) + P (m+, n+) ,

(17.4)

where P (k+, n+) is the joint probability for Alice to measure ’spin-up’ in kdirection (hσka i = +) and Bob to measure ’spin-up’ in n-direction (hσnb i = +).

17.1. QUANTUM CORRELATIONS AND ENTANGLEMENT

Alice and Bob perform their experiments along the three possible directions
êk , êm , ên and they can get spin-up (+) or spin-down (−) in each direction.
Furthermore, if Alice measures k+, Bob must also measure k+,

(17.6)

It is easy to see that the inequality (17.4) is satisfied, and we conclude that the
hidden variables hypothesis respects Bell’s inequality. In contrast, in quantum
mechanics the probabilities depend on angles between the measurement axes,
P (k+, m+) = P (k−, m−) = sin2
P (k+, m−) = P (k−, m+) =

θkm

cos2 θkm

(17.7)

and analogously for P (k+, n+) and P (m+, n+). Then, the Bell inequality becomes,
sin2 θkn
≤ sin2 θkm
+ sin2 θmn
.
(17.8)

Suppose that the angles between each direction are θkm = π4 , θmn = π4 , and
θkn = π2 , so the inequality (17.8) results in 0.5 ≤ 0.146 + 0.146. Obviously, the
inequality is violated.
Actually, the inequality (17.8) is violated for any angle between 0 and π/2, because the system is invariant under rotation. In conclusion, quantum mechanics
violates Bell’s inequality, such that an experimental test of the inequality must
tell us, whether the hidden variables theory or quantum mechanics is correct.
Example 77 (GHZ states): Here, we show a modified version of the EPR
experiment proposed by Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger (GHZ) based on
the GHZ state [246]. They imagined a source creating three correlated noninteracting spin 1/2 particles flying toward three Stern-Gerlach type magnetic
detectors, which measure the spins in x or in y-direction. The correct state is
either quantum,
|ψi = | +a +b +c i − | −a −b −c i or contains hidden variables

|ψi = ±±±
.
We
know from quantum mechanics, that,
±±±
σ̂x |±ix = |∓ix

and

ıσ̂y |±ix = ∓|∓ix .

(17.9)

From this follows,
σ̂xa σ̂xb σ̂xc |ψi = −|ψi ,

Hidden variables in a state |ψi that is not a coherent superposition should at
least be able to predict how each particle will behave in its respective detector,
when we measure each one of the two spin components. Eight combinations can
satisfy the requirement (17.11):

but none satisfies (17.10). Therefore, the EPR critique of quantum mechanics
regarding non-locality and its incompleteness must be refuted 1 .

Which one of the two pictures is correct, the hidden variables assumption or
quantum mechanics, can actually be tested by Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment.
It consists of using pairs of correlated photons emitted in different directions, where
they are expected by photodetectors. Polarizers located in front of the detectors fix
the quantization axis to êx or êy , but the choice of the axis is made only after the
photons were created by the source, in order to avoid possible backactions of the
polarizers on the source 2 . Bell’s inequality condition [49] predicts a statistics for the
results of repeated measurements where the orientation of the polarizers is randomly
varied. The experiment run by Aspect [22, 21] showed that the assumption of hidden
variables violates local realism and thus confirmed quantum mechanics as being a
complete theory.
1 Note that the coupling of different degrees of freedom is not an entanglement, but it is the
condition for being able to generate entanglement.
2 We note that first attempts to demonstrate wave-particle duality with single photons in dilute
laser beams are not really conclusive, because the attenuation of a coherent state does NOT result
in a single photon states (non-classical Fock state). Even if on average only less than one photon is
in the interferometer, this may still be a Glauber state. Nonetheless, real single photon experiments
involving the deexcitation of individual atoms by emission of two photons, produced the same result.

Information entropy

According to von Neumann, we can define the von Neumann entropy, also called
quantum information entropy as,
X
S ≡ −hlog2 ρ̂i = Tr (ρ̂ log2 ρ̂) = −
ρ̂n log2 ρ̂n ,
(17.13)
n

where ρn ≡ hn|ρ̂|ni. For statistically independent systems the density operator is
ρ̂ = ρ̂1 ⊗ ρ̂2 and the entropy is additive S = S1 + S2 . The entropy is observable, that
is, independent of the basis and invariant with respect to unitary transformations.
Therefore, ρ̂ can be diagonalized and can be assumed diagonal in the following examples. For N independent qubits the density operator ρ̂(N ) and the entropy S (N )
are:
ρ̂(0) = |1ih1|

,

S (0) = 0 bit

,

S (1) = 1 bits

ρ̂(2) = 14 (|11ih11| + |12ih12| + |21ih21| + |22ih22|)

,

S (2) = 2 bits

,

S (N ) = N bits .

ρ̂(1) = 12 (|1ih1| + |2ih2|)
ρ̂(N ) =

1
2N

(|11...ih11...| + ...)

(17.14)

The set is canonical and the entropy maximal. On the other hand, if the states are
entangled, the entropy is always less than S (N ) = N bits. For the state of maximally
entangled spins, we have,

The division of a beam is an incoherent process in the sense that it increases the
entropy. The process is irreversible. The divided beams can not be recombined by

However, the phase is preserved.
The quantum information content is defined by the deviation from maximum entropy,
Q = Smx − Sactual .
(17.19)
If the system is in a mixed state, the entropy measures deviations from a pure state
behavior [42].

identical photons and a 50:50 beam splitter. This is called the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect
in quantum optics. Three- and four-photon NOON states cannot be created deterministically from single-photon states, but they have been created probabilistically
via post-selection using spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

17.2

Creation of quantum correlations

Since the experimental verification of Bell’s inequality [23] numerous ideas were proposed for the creation and application of correlated states in distant particles. Realistic proposals on how to create such states are often based on a Jaynes-Cummings
type coupling between states of atomic excitation and the degrees of freedom of a
harmonic oscillator. The Jaynes-Cummings dynamics has been extensively studied
in micromasers, where the non-resonant interaction of an atomic transition with the
TEM00 mode of a stored radiation field generates quantum coherences. In very high
finesse cavities, light field states with sub-Poissonian photon statistics can be generated and stored for macroscopic times, and schemes for the creation of Fock states
and Schrödinger cat states were proposed and tested. Furthermore, the electronic excitation states of atoms successively traversing a micromaser can be correlated under
suitable conditions. The availability of fundamental techniques motivated proposals
for the investigation of phenomena such as EPR correlations, quantum teleportation,
and quantum switching [186]. On the other hand, quantum coherences are very fragile
to dissipation and rapidly decay when exposed to perturbations.
Jaynes-Cummings type dynamics can also be realized with a single ion stored
in a Paul trap, where the interaction of its mechanical motion with an electronic
transition [74] can induce very stable quantum coherences in the vibrational degrees
of freedom. Schrödinger cat states have already been demonstrated in this system
[415], as well as fundamental parts of a quantum computer, the quantum controlled
not gate [415] and the quantum phase gate [622]. A possible extension of these ideas is
the collective Jaynes-Cummings interaction of a sample of ions with an optical field,
where the vibrational degrees of freedom are coupled through Coulomb repulsion.
Such scenarios are close to the currently most realistic ideas of quantum computers
[120].

In order to correlate particles, they must be able to exchange information, that is,
they must interact. One method used on ions trapped in a linear Paul trap, where they
form a straight chain, and also on neutral atoms trapped in a dual optical lattice,
consists in letting them undergo controlled collisions controlledcollision [323]. The
conditional quantum operation proposed by Jaksch et al. is based on a conditional
collisional phase shift, the condition being that the atoms are in a particular state
of excitation. In a suggestive notation for the Bloch vector of a particle subject to a
resonant radiation pulse, the interaction is described by,

Alternative approaches to realizing quantum gates use dipole-dipole interactions
[92], conditional Raman adiabatic passages by laser-induced excitation of interatomic
dipole-dipole interactions [393], or interactions between permanent dipoles of atoms
in Rydberg states [324] 3
In Sec. 15.2 we showed already that the Jaynes-Cummings model is able to perform coherent operations on a two-level system –which from now on we will call qubit–,
such as the population inversion (NOT-gate) and the controlled dephasing of an excited dipole moment (phase gate). These operations are fundamental for applications
in quantum information, however, we still lack essential ingredients allowing us to
entangle states of two, three or more qubits in order to perform a quantum register of
qubits. Once these register are realized, we must define coherent quantum operations
called quantum gates.

17.2.1

The Jaynes-Cummings model for 2 atoms and 1 light
mode

In Sec. 15.2 we showed, how a Jaynes-Cummings interaction between an atom and
a radiation field can exchange quantum correlations. It is reasonable to expect that,
when we have two (or more) atoms interacting with the same radiation field, we can
exchange correlations between atoms via the field. This would allow the implementation of entanglement protocols and quantum gates. We will disregard spontaneous
processes, such that all couplings are then coherent and the processes reversible.
In Sec. 2.3.8 we learned, how to span a Hilbert space of various particles. We
will now apply these notions in the scope of generalizing the Jaynes-Cummings model
to two atoms interacting with the same optical mode, without spontaneous decay
processes considered. The system is often referred to as the Tavis-Cummings model.
The Hamiltonian of the system, which consists of two non-interacting atoms, both
coupled in the same optical mode, is,

Correlating atoms in the JCM model

The investigations of the last section can be applied to describe the transfer of quantum coherence from one atom to another. The size of our system is now increased
by the additional degrees of freedom, provided by internal states of the second atom.
A suitable basis was defined in equation (2.109). Now, we imagine the following
Gedankenexperiment: Starting from the initial condition that two adjacent atoms
are in their respective electronic ground states, we assume a microwave π/2-pulse to
create simultaneously, but independently on both atoms, a superposition of the HFS
levels. Then, a non-resonant optical π-pulse interacts with the upper HFS level of
the first atom |1iA1 , and afterward the second atom |2iA2 . Instead of reducing the
atomic states and preparing a Schrödinger cat state in the optical field, (as we did
in Sec. 15.2), we now project the field state onto the coherent state |βi and leave
the atoms in a correlated state. The total procedure can be resumed by tracing the

Finally, the correlation of the spin orientation of the atoms must be probed with
additional laser light fields, which are selectively irradiated onto the atoms and resonantly tuned to a rapidly decaying optical transition. The states correlated in this
way show a relatively low order entanglement, the von Neumann information entropy
only being S 0 = −hlog2 ρi = N − 1.

Dicke states in the Jaynes-Cummings model

The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian for two atoms in the limit ∆1 = ∆2 and Ω1 = Ω2
(both atoms are inside the mode volume of the field and are indistinguishable) is given
by (17.30). This matrix shows two identical and non-shifted eigenvalues at λ = nω,
det(Hn − λI) = (nω − λ)2 [(nω − λ)2 − ∆2 − nΩ2 ] = 0 .

(17.47)

The description of the dynamics can be simplified by reducing the order of the matrix
by calculating the average of the lines 2 and 3,

The new Hamiltonian has the same eigenvalues λ = nω, nω ± $n , but without degeneracies. If we assume furthermore that the excitation is resonant, ∆ = 0, with high

or N atoms is easy. We define 2J as the number of atoms, M asP
the collective atomic
spin, n as the number of photons in the optical mode, and S ± ≡ i σi± . The so-called
Dicke state |J, M, ni basically consists of a set of N indistinguishable spin-1/2 states
(~ ≡ 1). We introduce a basis by,

|J, J, ni

(17.53)

The Dicke states |JM i follow the SU(2) algebra. With this, we can calculate the
number of particles with spin up:
N̂± = Jˆ± Jˆ∓ = Ĵ2 − Jˆz2 ± Jˆz

N̂+ = 12 (N̂+ − N + N̂+ + N ) = 12 (N̂+ − N̂− + N ) = Jˆz + J .

(17.54)

CHAPTER 17. ENTANGLEMENT AND QUANTUM GATES

In the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞, the operators can be replaced by:
N →∞
Jˆx −→ 12 N̂ cos ϕ̂

and

N →∞
Jˆy −→ 12 N̂ sin ϕ̂ .

(17.55)

In this case, the operators commute [Jˆx , Jˆy ] → 0.

17.2.5

Spin squeezing

Measuring the population of a coherently excited two-level system by projecting it
onto an energy eigenstate introduces quantum projection noise. This noise is inherent to determination of the resonance frequency and can only be surpassed by spin
squeezing [654]. The projection noise limit has been observed with ions [316, 308]
and with atomic clouds [544]. The reduction of the noise by spin squeezing has been
observed with ions [536], micromasers [513], and atomic clouds [268, 375]. Also, a
weakly entangled state of two modes was observed for continuous spin variables [336].
Very strong squeezing spin can be obtained in a Mott insulator state, as demonstrated
by [247].

17.3

Quantum gates

In quantum information we use the notions introduced in the preceding sections and
formalize the calculation. In this section, we present a brief formal introduction to
the field of quantum computation with qubit matrices. The formalism is abstract, but
we may keep in mind a chain of entangled ions confined in a linear Paul trap. We will
show how the electronic states of the ions are correlated to form a single collective
state, and how quantum gates can be realized on such correlated particles. With three
ions, an arbitrary quantum gate can be implemented, which includes and generalizes
the three-bit Toffoli gate.
To construct a quantum gate, we need at least two qubits spanning a 4-dimensional
Hilbert space, since H2 ⊗ H2 and H1 ⊗ H4 are isomorph, that is,

|εi1 |µi2

, |0i1 |εµi2

The qubit

As we have seen above, the two principle ways a light mode acts on a two-level
system are the resonant interaction and the dispersive interaction. From the Jaynes-

The field of quantum information

The possibility to experimentally control, manipulate and read out individual qubits
and gave birth to a new field of physics in the past two decades now called quantum
information. This fields includes the more specific areas of quantum processing (which
itself splits into the subareas of quantum computing and quantum simulation), quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Let us begin spending a few words on
quantum sensing.
17.3.6.1

Quantum sensing

A quantum sensor is a measurement device exploiting quantum correlations in the
form of quantum superpositions or entanglement to improve the sensitivity and resolution. Typically its core is a single qubit (or an incoherent ensemble of qubits)
whose superposition states (i) are sensitive to some environment parameter, (ii) can
be manipulated in a controlled way, and (iii) can be read out.
A typical quantum sensor can be described by the generic Hamiltonian [159],
Ĥ(t) = Ĥqbit + Ĥcntrl (t) + Ĥint (t) ,

(17.77)

composed of a (known) internal Hamiltonian Ĥqbit , a control Hamiltonian Ĥcntrl
allowing to manipulate or tune the sensor, and a signal Hamiltonian Ĥint allowing to
pass information about the state of the system to the outside world.
Typically, the internal Hamiltonian is static and defines the energy eigenstates |0i
and |1i,
Ĥqbit = E0 |0ih0| + E1 |1ih1| .
(17.78)
The qubit internal Hamiltonian may contain additional interactions, such as couplings to other qubits or time-dependent stochastic terms due to interactions with an
environment.
Many quantum sensing protocols require to manipulate the qubit either before,
during, or after the sensing process. This is achieved via a control Hamiltonian,
which allows implementing a sequence of appropriate quantum gates, such as the
Hadamard gate and or Pauli X and Y gates. These gates are nothing else than
what, in the language of atom interferometry is known as π/2 or π-pulses around
different axes. Advanced sensing schemes employing more than one sensor qubit
may further require conditional gates, especially controlled-NOT gates to generate
entanglement, swap gates to exploit memory qubits, and controlled phase shifts in
quantum phase estimation. Finally, the control Hamiltonian can include control fields
for systematically tuning the transition frequency ~ω0 = E1 − E2 .
Finally, the signal Hamiltonian represents the coupling between the sensor qubit
and a signal V (t) to be measured. When the signal is weak (which is assumed here)
Ĥint adds a small perturbation to the internal Hamiltonian. The signal Hamiltonian
can then be separated into two qualitatively different contributions,
Ĥint = Ĥint,k + Ĥint,⊥ ,

(17.79)

where Ĥint,k is the parallel (commuting) and Ĥint,⊥ the transverse (non-commuting)

592

CHAPTER 17. ENTANGLEMENT AND QUANTUM GATES

components, respectively. The two components can quite generally be captured by,
Ĥint,k = γ2 Vk (t)[|1ih1| − |0ih0|]
Ĥint,⊥ =

γ
2 [V⊥ (t)|1ih0|

+

V⊥† (t)|1ih0|]

(17.80)
,

where γ is the coupling or transduction parameter of the qubit to the signal V (t).
Examples of coupling parameters include the Zeeman shift parameter or the Stark
shift parameter of electric dipoles in an electric field. The parallel and transverse
components of a signal have distinctly different effects on the quantum sensor. A
commuting perturbation Ĥint,k leads to shifts of the energy levels and an associated
change of the transition frequency ω0 . A non-commuting perturbation Ĥint,⊥ , by
contrast, can induce transitions between levels, manifesting through an increased
transition rate. Most often, this requires the signal to be time dependent (resonant
with the transition) in order to have an appreciable effect on the quantum sensor.
An important class of signals are vector signal V(t), in particular, those provided
by electric or magnetic fields. The interaction between a vector signal and a qubit
can be described by the signal Hamiltonian,
ˆ,
Ĥint = γV(t) · ~σ

(17.81)

ˆ is the vector of Pauli matrices (2.47). For a vector signal, the two signal
where ~σ
functions Vk (t) and V⊥ (t) are,
Vk (t) = Vz (t)

(17.82)

V⊥ (t) = Vx (t) + ıVy (t) ,
where the z-direction is defined by the qubit’s quantization axis. The corresponding
signal Hamiltonian is,
ĤV (t) = γ σ̂x Re V⊥ (t) + γ σ̂y Im V⊥ (t) + γ σ̂z Vk (t) .

boson creation and annihilation operators, effectively truncating their infinitedimensional Fock space to finite-dimensional subspaces. Let us consider a spin
operator Ŝ defined by its commutation behavior [Ŝx , Ŝy ] = ı~Ŝz and characterized by its eigenvectors |s, ms i,
Ŝ 2 |s, ms i = ~2 s(s + 1)|s, ms i

,

Ŝz |s, ms i = ~ms |s, ms i ,

(17.84)

with the projection quantum number ms = −s, −s + 1, . . . , s − 1, s. We consider
a single particle of spin s and take the state |s, ms = +si as a vacuum for a set
of boson operators, and each subsequent state with lower projection quantum
number as a boson excitation of the previous one,
1
|s, s − ni 7→ √ (â† )n |0i .
n!

(17.85)

Each additional boson then corresponds to a decrease of ms in the spin projection. Thus, the spin raising and lowering operators Ŝ± = Ŝx ± ıŜy satisfying so
that [Ŝ+ , Ŝ− ] = 2~Ŝz correspond to bosonic annihilation and creation operators,
respectively. The precise relations between the operators must be chosen to ensure the correct commutation relations for the spin operators. The resulting
Holstein-Primakoff transformation can be written as,

Ŝz = ~(s − â† â) .

(17.86)
The transformation is particularly useful in the case where s is large, when the
square roots can be expanded as Taylor series, to give an expansion in decreasing
powers of s [607, 63].

17.3.6.2

Quantum Fourier transform

The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a linear transformation on qubits and the
quantum analogue of the inverse discrete Fourier transform. The quantum Fourier
transform is a part of many quantum algorithms, notably Shor’s algorithm for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm or the quantum phase estimation algorithm
for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator.
The quantum Fourier transform can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, with a particular decomposition into a product of simpler unitary matrices.
Using a simple decomposition, the discrete Fourier transform on 2n amplitudes can
be implemented as a quantum circuit consisting of only O(n2 ) Hadamard gates and
controlled phase shift gates, where n is the number of qubits. This can be compared
with the classical discrete Fourier transform, which takes O(2n ) gates, which is exponentially more than in the classical case. However, the quantum Fourier transform
acts on a quantum state, whereas the classical Fourier transform acts on a vector, so
not every task that uses the classical Fourier transform can take advantage of this
exponential speedup.
The quantum Fourier transform is the classical discrete Fourier transform applied
to the vector of amplitudes of a quantum state, where we usually consider vectors of
length N = 2n . The classical Fourier transform acts on a vector (x0 , x1 , . . . , xN −1 ) ∈

Similarly, the quantum Fourier transform acts on a quantum state |xi = i=0 xi |ii
PN −1
and maps it to a quantum state i=0 yi |ii according to the same formula (17.87).

as the map,

Equivalently, the quantum Fourier transform can be viewed as a unitary matrix (or
a quantum gate, similar to a Boolean logic gate for classical computers) acting on
quantum state vectors, where the unitary matrix is given by,

with e2πı/2 = ω(2m ) the primitive 2m -th root of unity. The circuit is composed of H
gates and the controlled version of Rm .
All quantum operations must be linear, so it suffices to describe the function on
each one of the basis states and let the mixed states be defined by linearity. This is
in contrast to how Fourier transforms are usually described. We normally describe
Fourier transforms in terms of how the components of the results are calculated on
an arbitrary input. This is how you would calculate the path integral or show BQP is
in PP. But it is much simpler here (and in many cases) to just explain what happens
to a specific arbitrary basis state, and the total result can be found by linearity.
The quantum Fourier transform can be approximately implemented for any N ;
however, the implementation for the case where N is a power of 2 is much simpler.

Figure 17.4: Quantum circuit for QFT with n qubits (without rearranging the order of
output states).

As already stated, we assume N = 2n . We have the orthonormal basis consisting of
the vectors |0i, . . . , |2n − 1i. The basis states enumerate all the possible states of the
qubits, |xi = |x1 x2 . . . xn i = |x1 i ⊗ |x2 i ⊗ · · · ⊗ |xn i, where |xj i indicates that qubit
j is in state xj , with xj either 0 or 1. By convention, the basis state index x orders
the possible states of the qubits lexicographically, i.e. by converting from binary to
decimal in this way:
x = x1 2n−1 + x2 2n−2 + · · · + xn 20 .

It is also useful to borrow fractional binary notation:

For instance, [0.x1 ] = x21 and [0.x1 x2 ] = x21 + x222 . With this notation, the action of
the quantum Fourier transform can be expressed in a compact manner:

the formula for the Fourier transform in the binary expansion:

then a(j) ∈ N0 , because 2n−j−r ≥ 0, for n−j−r ≥ 0, and b(j) = 0.xn−j+1 xn−j+2 . . . xn ,
thus the (2) becomes:
e2πıf (j) = e2πı(a(j)+b(j)) = e2πıa(j) · e2πıb(j) = e2πı[0.xn−j+1 xn−j+2 ···xn ] ,

since e2πıa(j) = 1 for all j. Then we can write:

To obtain this state from the circuit depicted above, a swap operations of the
qubits must be performed to reverse their order. After the reversal, the n-th output
qubit will be in a superposition state of |0i and e2πı [0.x1 ...xn ] |1i, and similarly the
other qubits before that (take a second look at the sketch of the circuit above).
In other words, the discrete Fourier transform, an operation on n qubits, can be
factored into the tensor product of n single-qubit operations, suggesting it is easily
represented as a quantum circuit (up to an order reversal of the output). In fact, each
of those single-qubit operations can be implemented efficiently using a Hadamard
gate and controlled phase gates. The first term requires one Hadamard gate and
(n − 1) controlled phase gates, the next one requires a Hadamard gate and (n − 2)
controlled phase gate, and each following term requires one fewer controlled phase
gate. Summing up the number of gates, excluding the ones needed for the output
reversal, gives n + (n − 1) + · · · + 1 = n(n + 1)/2 = O(n2 ) gates, which is quadratic
polynomial in the number of qubits.

Nonlinear optics
The discipline of nonlinear optics studies phenomena that occur as a consequence of
modifications of the optical properties of materials by the presence of light. Such
modifications are appreciable only, when the interacting light is sufficiently intense,
i.e. of the order of the interatomic electric field,
Eat =

e2
' 5.14 · 1011 V/m ,
4πε0 a2B

(18.1)

which explains that nonlinear effects could only be studied properly after the advent
of the laser.
In general, light-matter interaction is expressed through the relationship between
the polarization induced in the medium, P (ω), with the optical light field, E(ω). In
linear optics this relation can be expressed as,
P̃ (ω) = ε0 χ(ω)Ẽ(ω) .

(18.2)

But in the perturbative regime of non-linear optics this expression must be generalized
to a series of powers of the electric field,
P̃ (ω) = ε0 [χ(1) (ω)Ẽ(ω) + χ(2) (ω)Ẽ 2 (ω) + χ(3) (ω)Ẽ 3 (ω) + ...] ,

(18.3)

so that higher order polarization terms, P (n) (ω) = ε0 χ(n) E N (ω), are considered.
Therefore, the phenomena are non-linear in the sense that they depend non-linearly
on the optical field applied to the material. In a more complete treatment, in terms
of the optical properties of materials, P̃ and Ẽ are vector fields and the electric
susceptibility is a tensor. However, to simplify the treatment, we consider the fields
as scalars and χ(n) as constants independent of the frequency ω.
Examples of non-linear optical phenomena are: parametric processes of sum and
difference frequency generation, as shown in Fig. 18.1, optical parametric oscillation,
and the dependence of the refractive index with the optical intensity. Examples of nonparametric processes are: multi-photonic absorption, stimulated Raman scattering,
and saturated absorption. In the latter example, the absorption coefficient of the
material decreases with increasing light intensity:
α0
α=
.
(18.4)
1 + I/Is
Saturated absorption is an example where a perturbative approach is not capable of
providing good results, and its most reliable description is given by the approximation
of a two-level quantum system.

CHAPTER 18. NONLINEAR OPTICS

Figure 18.1: Parametric (a) sum and (b) difference frequency generation. (c) Third harmonic
generation.

It is also important to emphasize that parametric processes are those, in which
the initial and final quantum states of a system are identical. Consequently, the
population of an initial state can only be moved to a virtual state, different in energy
by ∆E, for a short time lapse limited by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (~/∆E).
Nonparametric processes are those involving population transfer between real energy
levels, eigenstates of the system’s Hamiltonian. In terms of the electrical susceptibility
of the medium, χ(n) is a real quantity for parametric and an imaginary one for nonparametric processes.

18.1

The nonlinear optical susceptibility

The description of nonlinear optical phenomena can be approached from a variety of
perspectives, most of which are semi-classical in the sense that the matter is treated
quantum mechanically, while the electromagnetic radiation is treated classically. One
possible description explores the wave nature of the radiation, using Maxwell’s equations to describe the generation of new spectral components by the nonlinear terms of
the polarization. More generally, this description explains how different frequencies
can be coupled through their nonlinear interaction with the material. It can be shown
that the electromagnetic wave equation in the nonlinear regime is,
∇Ẽ −

1 ∂2
n2 ∂ 2
Ẽ
=
P̃ ,
c2 ∂t2
ε0 c2 ∂t2

(18.5)

such that P̃ = P̃ (1) + P̃ nl . In this view, P̃ nl acts as a source of frequencies, several of
that are incident.
Although electromagnetic theory is capable of explaining several aspects of nonlinear optics, it is the quantum description that provides explicit expressions for nonlinear optical susceptibility. There are three main motivations for obtaining quantum
expressions:
 They reveal a functional form of the nonlinear optical susceptibility and show
how they depend on microscopic parameters of the material, such as transition
dipole moments and atomic energy levels.
 They exhibit the intrinsic symmetries of nonlinear susceptibility.

18.1. THE NONLINEAR OPTICAL SUSCEPTIBILITY

601

 They can be used to calculate numerically the values of nonlinear susceptibilities.

The numerical predictions of quantum theory for nonlinear optical susceptibilities
are particularly accurate in the case of atomic vapors, because the atomic parameters
of these are known with sufficient precision for the theory to provide reliable results.
Two quantum mechanical formalisms can be used for the calculation of nonlinear
optical susceptibilities. Perturbation theory is used to make predictions on nonresonant systems, i.e. situations where the photon energy is much smaller than the
energy separation between two eigenstates of the material. On the other hand, when
the interactions are close to resonance, such that it becomes necessary to include relaxation processes, the state-density matrix formalism is used. Although this approach
is more complex, it provides better results.

18.1.1

Hanle effect

The Hanle effect occurs when a magnetic and an optical field compete for the quantization axis. Imagine an atom irradiated by a laser from direction k = kêx , linearly
~ = Bêz . The fluorescence is
polarized ε = êy and subject to a magnetic field B
detected in direction êy through a linear polarizer [165].
If B = 0, no light is emitted into the detector since the dipole radiation pattern
is a torus with symmetry axis êy . If B is now increased, the quantization axis is
tilted and the torus slowly precesses about the êx axis. Plotting the time-averaged
fluorescence as a function of the magnetic field B, we observe a dark resonance. These
arguments are rather classical.
Quantum mechanically, Hanle resonances are easily calculated. The transition
rates additionally depend on the relative orientation of the laser polarization and
the magnetic field direction. This dependence is accounted for by decomposing the
polarization vector into the coordinates defined by,
ê3 =

~

ê2 =

ê3 × ĝ

ê1 =

where ĝ is an arbitrarily chosen direction, e.g. gravity. The relative amplitude of the
transitions ∆mJ = 0 is proportional to the projection of the polarization vector on
the magnetic field axis ζπ = (ε̂ · ê3 )2 . To estimate the amplitude of the transitions
∆mJ = ±1, we must project onto the coordinates,

Quantum interference

We have seen earlier that a dark resonance in Λ-shaped three-level systems create
superposition states between the two stable ground states which allow the adiabatic
elimination of the excited state. Dark resonances may be understood as destructively
interfering excitation paths at Raman-coherences between inneratomic transitions.
Quantum interference is at the origin of various other phenomena which are discussed
in the following sections.

18.2.1

Lasing without inversion

The question of the necessity of population inversion to construct a laser has been the
subject of debates. Indeed, even an ordinary two-level system may exhibit gain with
a small frequency interval [439] known as Mollow gain. Lasing without population
inversion may also result from a splitting of emission and absorption spectra caused
by atomic recoil as in the example of CARL [80].
Various schemes of a laser without inversion (LWI) have been proposed. Here is
one of them [462]. We will discuss an example in Exc. 18.2.3.1.

18.2. QUANTUM INTERFERENCE

Figure 18.2: Dressed states level scheme for LWI. Quantum interference between two possible
Raman transitions (green) leads to a cancellation of the ground state population. When the
upper level |hi is incoherently pumped, gain can be reached for a weak probe field. Inserting
the atoms in a cavity one can reach lasing [306].

18.2.2

Brillouin scattering

Stimulated scattering of phonons is called stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). Like
Raman-scattering (SRS) Brillouin-scattering is a limiting factor for the transmission
efficiency in optical fibers. It is used in acousto-optic modulators (AOM). While SBS
is based on the exchange of phonons between atoms bound in crystals, SRS is based
on the exchange of phonons between atoms bound in molecules.
Raman-scattering (in a restricted historical sense) is very common technique of
molecular spectroscopy. The process is Rayleigh-scattering at an electronic transition,
but towards a different vibrational substate. Brillouin-scattering also involves the
motional state of the scatterer, but its center-of-mass motion rather than some internal
degree of freedom. It is also related to polariton scattering in solids, which produces
optical phonons, rather than acoustic phonons.
If a strong electromagnetic field (pump laser) is irradiated into a medium (typically a crystal or a fluid) it produces a time-varying electrostrictive strain, which can
be understood as the reaction force of particles dislocated from their equilibrium position. The strain is quantized into phonons and may drive a sound wave. This wave
modulates the optical dielectric constant ε and thus create a periodic polarization
~ This polarization may now interact with the incident electric field (pump laser
P.
ω2 , k2 , E~2 ). The resulting energy exchange can, under suitable circumstances, lead to
simultaneous amplification of a probe wave (ω2 , k2 , E~2 ) and a sound wave (ωs , ks , us ).
Let us consider a 1D geometry, kj = kj êz and E~j = Ej êx . (More general geometries can be considered [672]). The pump field E2 (t, z) causes a strain ∂us /∂z via
longitudinal displacements us (z, t) of test volumes. This strain produces a modulation of ε by δε = −γ∂us /∂z, where γ is the strain coefficient (or coupling strength).
The modulation of the dielectric constant δε now modulates the interaction energy
δU = − 21 δεE2 , which exerts work p∂us /∂z = δU against the pressure p. The pressure modulation creates a force F = −∂p/∂z = 12 γ∂E22 /∂z. We can now set up a

Here ρ is the mass density, optical losses are described by α, and η is the dissipation
constant for phonons. ε1 ≈ ε0 . The scattering satisfies the Bragg condition k2 − k1 =
ks . The above equations describe exponential gain and threshold behavior for E1 and
us . For backscattering k1 k2 = −k1 k2 the rate of growth for the probe E1 is influenced
by the values of E1 lying ahead in the direction k1 . This is by virtue of the sound
beam propagating in opposite direction to E1 and provides the positive feedback being
at the origin of exponential gain.
The equations are reminiscent to the CARL equations. The difference is the nature
of the mediating force field: The CARL force is mediated by photons. The mediation
is thus instantaneous. Photons do not require a medium in order to propagate. In
contrast, the Brillouin-gain is mediated by phonons. Phonons propagate through a
gas by collisions. Sound needs a medium to propagate. In dilute gases where CARL is
observed, collisions are totally neglegible. Brillouin-scattering may lead to bunching,
which propagates along ks . But similar to water waves, which do not transport the
water molecules, the bunching does not lead to a net transport of atoms.
Just like CARL and the superradiant Rayleigh scattering in BECs SBS can be
understood as being mediated by dipole-dipole interactions (i.e. the exchange of real
or virtual photons between atoms). In a BECs SBS can be interpreted as phonon-like
excitations (smaller momentum transfer) due to dipole-dipole interactions [238], while
CARL are particle-like excitations due to dipole-dipole interactions (the nature of
scattered particles changes from recoiling atoms to phonons). Note that while ultralow
temperatures are necessary, these effects are not base on superfluidity, i.e. binary
collisions. Thus the speed of sound is not the Bogolubov sound. The question is
whether quantum degeneracy plays a role.

Chapter 19

Atomic motion in
electromagnetic fields
So far – and especially in Sec. 3.9.2– we analyzed the motion of quantum particles
in potential landscapes without specifying the physical origin of the potentials. We
know the gravitational force, which can be derived from the Earth’s homogeneous
attraction,
F = −∇Vgrv = −∇(mgz) = −gmêz .
(19.1)
Another fundamental force comes from electromagnetism. We have already studied –
mainly in Sec. 9.4– the reaction of the electronic shell in atoms subjected to applied
electromagnetic fields.
In contrast, the present chapter is devoted to the motion of the atomic center-ofmass subject to forces resulting from interactions with electromagnetic fields. We will
begin, in the first section, with electromagnetic forces of the Coulomb-Lorentz type
acting on charges (e.g. ions), permanent electric dipoles (e.g. polar molecules), or permanent magnetic dipoles (e.g. paramagnetic atoms). Also, more complex situations
will be discussed, such as the scattering of light by confined atoms, atoms interacting
with optical cavities, and adiabatic potentials.
The second section will entirely be devoted to the forces exerted by light beams,
in particular the radiation pressure and the optical dipole force, which are nowadays
widely used in atomic cooling and trapping experiments. We will leave the issue of the
application of these forces to Chp. 24.7.3 and concentrate here on the (semiclassical
or quantum) derivation and the interpretation of the forces. In fact, to understand
optical forces acting on atoms, we need to consider their internal degrees of freedom.
Apart from the degrees of freedom related to their center-of-mass motion (kinetic
or potential energy), many quantum objects are endowed with internal degrees of freedom, for example, the motion of electrons inside atoms or molecules. In the simplest
case, the Hamiltonian of such a system is composed of an outer part, comprising the
kinetic and the potential energy, and an inner part counting for the excitation energy
~ω0 of an internal state |ei,
Ĥatm =

p2
+ V (r) + ~ω0 |eihe| .
2m

(19.2)

The time scale of the electronic motion is usually very rapid compared to the motion
of the nucleus, where (almost) the entire mass of the atom is concentrated. Therefore,
607

608

CHAPTER 19. ATOMIC MOTION IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

the external (nuclear) dynamics decouples from the internal (electronic) one, which
allows the separation of the total wavefunction in two parts,
|ψi = |ψiext |ψiele ,

(19.3)

where for a simple two-level atom, |ψ(t)iele = cg (t)|gi + ce (t)|ei, with the atomic
ground state |gi and the excited state |ei. The external states are eigenstates of the
momentum in the case of a free particle, |ψiext = |pi. For particles confined in a potential the external states are the vibrational eigenstates, |ψiext = |ni. The temporal
evolutions of the internal and external degrees of freedom are governed by independent Schrödinger equations. For cold atomic clouds the kinetic energy is much smaller
than the excitation energy, which allows the separation of the energy scales. That is,
the internal degrees of freedom are frozen in the ground state. Many phenomena, for
example, Bose-Einstein condensation and the dynamics of condensates are described
in this regime.

Figure 19.1: The internal degrees of freedom of cold atoms are thermally frozen.

Nevertheless, the fact that it is thermally frozen does not prevent the intentional
excitation of the internal degree of freedom by irradiating electromagnetic fields tuned
close to resonances and coupling electronic energy levels. In the case of coupling, the
external and internal degrees of freedom must both be considered.

19.1

Electromagnetic forces

Obviously, in order to allow for forces acting on the atomic center-of-mass, the atomic
Hamiltonian must contain terms depending on the center-of-mass coordinates:
F = −h∇Ĥint i .

(19.4)

We will see shortly that some of terms may be dissipative, other conservative.
The impact of electromagnetic fields on the internal dynamics of atoms has already
been studied in the Chp. 9.4. Here, we will focus on the force on the center-ofmass exerted by the gradient of electromagnetic potentials, where the Hamiltonian in
Eq. (19.4) of a charge interacting with electromagnetic fields is obtained in minimum
coupling (9.11) by,

From this formula we can, in principle, calculate all electromagnetic forces.
The coupling of external and internal degrees of freedom is mediated by the photonic recoil transferred to the atom during absorption and emission processes. That
is, the feature that the interaction with light simultaneously excites the atom and
exerts a force couples the degrees of freedom. This fact manifests itself in the Hamiltonian of the atom interacting with a light field (15.17) by the appearance of terms
joining operators acting on different degrees of freedom,
Ĥ = ~ωâ† â + Ĥint + Ĥatm
where
Ĥint = ~Ω(r̂)eık·r̂ â† σ̂ + c.c. ,
(19.6)
P
~
where σ̂ ≡ |gihe| and â ≡ n |nihn+1| and ~Ω(r̂) ≡ d12 · E(r̂)
is the coupling constant
or Rabi frequency . The Hamiltonian is that of the Jaynes-Cummings model, except
that in addition to the field operators â and the atom transition operators σ̂, appears
an operator for the position of the atom r̂, whose quantum features we have not taken
very seriously so far. It appears in the Rabi frequency and also in the term eik·r̂ . Now,
we must remember, that
Urecoil = e−ık·r̂ = |p + ~kihp|

(19.7)

is the unitary operator of the photonic recoil in the absorption process. We shall
shortly see, that it is precisely this term in the Hamiltonian that gives rise to all
phenomena related to light forces on atoms.
The presence of the position operator in the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian introduces a new degree of freedom. With no external potential (that is, the system is invariant to spatial translations), this degree of freedom is simply the atomic
center-of-mass momentum, such that the new set of quantum numbers is |j, n, pi.
Strictly speaking we have to span the whole Hilbert space by an external product,
Ĥele ⊗ Ĥrad ⊗ Ĥext .

19.1.1

Forces on charges and electric dipole moments

As shown in Eq. (9.8), the equations (19.4) and (19.5) (obviously) lead to CoulombLorentz forces on charges and currents.
In atomic optics, the Coulomb-Lorentz force is used, for example, to accelerate or
trap ions (see Sec. 24.5) and other electrically charged particles.
Atoms naturally do not exhibit permanent electric dipole moments, when they are
not subject to external electric fields. In contrast, polar molecules (such as heteronuclear dimers), which have permanent electric dipole moments can have their motion
be influenced by inhomogeneous electric fields (see Sec. 24.5.3).

19.1.2

Forces on magnetic dipole moments

Neutral atoms are insensitive to electric fields. But as we have already seen in
Chp. 9.4, the orbital motion of the electrons corresponds to a circular current generating a permanent magnetic dipole moment µ
~ , which can interact with external
magnetic fields. We have already shown in the calculation (9.15) and (9.19) that the
interaction energy (19.5) can be written as,

(19.9)

Here, J = L + S is the total angular momentum resulting from the coupling of the
total angular orbital momentum and the total spin of all electrons. If the atom has
a nuclear spin I other than zero, then F = J + I replaces J in Eq. (19.8), and the

In Sec. 9.2 we used the formula (19.8) to calculate the Zeeman shift of internal
energy levels. But, according to the formula (19.4), the interaction also generates a
force acting on the center-of-mass of atom,
f = −gF µB mF ∇B .

(19.11)

In case of absence of hyperfine structure we simply replace F by J.
Obviously, force is conditioned by the existence of a gradient of the absolute value
of the magnetic field. It was first used in the famous Stern-Gerlach experiment, which
led to the discovery of the electron (see Sec. 4.3.3). In atomic optics (see Sec. 24.4), this
force is widely used to create magnetic traps for cold atoms. Resolve the Excs. 9.2.8.2,
19.1.4.1, and 19.1.4.2.

Adiabatic potentials

Adiabatic potentials can be used to realize more complicated trapping geometries
[136]. To study adiabatic potentials we consider the two-level system | 21 , 21 i ↔ | 12 , − 12 i
coupled by an incident radiation (e.g. a radiofrequency). A generalization to multilevel
systems F > 12 is simple. The dressed states Hamiltonian of our two-level system is

If the atoms enter the coupling area adiabatically, the populations of the adiabatic
potentials will only depend on z. This is analogous to the adiabatic transfer via adiabatic sweeps or STIRAP pulse sequences. If the atoms are too fast, the populations
also depend on history (i.e. the recent trajectory of the atoms), which can result in
Landau-Zener transitions to other (possibly untrapped) states.

Optical forces

Light carries momentum, and the scattering of light by an object produces a force on
that object. Although these properties of light are direct consequences of Maxwell’s
classical theory of electromagnetism, they were only verified in 1933 by Frisch, who
observed a very small transverse deviation (3 · 10−5 rad) of an atomic sodium beam
exposed to the light of a lamp. With the invention of the laser, it became easier to
observe the light’s mechanical effects, because the more intense and highly directional
laser light exerts much larger forces. Although these results sparked the interest in
using light forces to control the motion of neutral atoms, the fundamental bases for
understanding the physics of light forces were not developed before the late 1970s.
Unequivocal experimental demonstrations of cooling and trapping of atoms were not
performed before the mid-1980s. In this section we will discuss some fundamental
aspects of light forces. Practical schemes used to cool and trap neutral atoms will be
presented in Secs. 24.2 and 24.3.

19.2. OPTICAL FORCES

613

The light force acting on an atom can be of two types: a spontaneous dissipative
force and a conservative dipole force. The spontaneous force arises from the recoil
experienced by an atom when it absorbs or emits a quantum of light. As we saw
in Sec. 1.2.6, when an atom scatters light, the resonant scattering cross section can
λ2
be written as in Eq. (1.73), σ0a = gg21 2π0 , where λ0 is the resonant wavelength. In
the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum the wavelengths of light are of the
order of several hundred nanometers, and the resonant cross sections for scattering
become very large, (∼ 10−9 cm2 ). Each absorbed photon transfers a quantum of
momentum ~k to the atom in the direction of propagation. Spontaneous emission
following an absorption process occurs in random directions and, hence, averaged
over many absorption-emission cycles, it cancels to zero. Consequently, the total
spontaneous force acts on the atom in the propagation direction of the light, as shown
schematically in the diagram of Fig. 19.3. The saturated photon scattering rate via
spontaneous emission (the reciprocal value of the excited state’s lifetime) sets the
upper limit for the magnitude of the force. This force is called radiation pressure
force.
The dipolar gradient force can be easily understood by considering light as a classical wave. It is simply the time-averaged force resulting from the interaction of the
transition dipole –induced by the oscillating electric field of the light– with the gradient of the electric field amplitude. The strength of this gradient can be controlled,
e.g. by focusing the light beam. By tuning the optical frequency below or above an
atomic transition, we can control the sign of the force acting on the atom: Tuning
the light below resonance attracts the atom to the center of the light beam, tuning
it above resonance repels it. The dipole force is a stimulated process without energy exchange between the field and the atom. Photons are absorbed in one light
mode and reappear by stimulated emission in another one. However, conservation
of momentum requires that the change in the propagation direction of the scattered
photons from an initial mode to a final mode leaves the atom with a recoil. Contrary
to spontaneous force, there is, in principle, no upper limit for the magnitude of the
dipole force, since it is a function of the field gradient only and the detuning.
Within the theory of electromagnetism we calculate radiative forces on charges
via Maxwell’s stress tensor 2 . The interaction of radiation with atoms having internal
degrees of freedom exhibiting resonances can be treated qualitatively by the Lorentz
model 3 .
In the following, we will show quantitative semi-classical and quantum calculations: The force of a light beam on an atom can be calculated in many different ways,
each emphasizing a slightly different aspect: From the classical Lorentz force exerted
on an atom by electromagnetic fields we can derive a semi-classical Fokker-Planck
equation [599]. In Sec. 19.2.1 we will derive the two contributions (dipole force and
radiative pressure) within a semi-classical theory [241]. Wineland et al. [656] chose
as starting point the cross section for an elementary scattering process (Sec. 19.2.3).
Dalibard et al. [148] developed a quantum theory using the dressed states representation (Sec. 19.2.2). And Cirac et al. [117] showed an approach based on the master
equation (Sec. 19.2.3).

CHAPTER 19. ATOMIC MOTION IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

19.2.1

The dipolar gradient force and the radiation pressure
force

To compute the forces of light on an atom, we describe the atom as a two-level system:
A fundamental level |1i and an excited level |2i decaying to the fundamental level
with the rate Γ. The energy difference between the levels is ω0 ≡ E2 − E1 . The light
with frequency ω is derived from a laser beam, which can be detuned from the atomic
transition, ∆ ≡ ω − ω0 . To describe the interaction, we consider the part (19.6) of the
total Hamiltonian describing the interaction [148]. Using the semi-classical density
operator ρ̂ 4 , we can calculate the force that the light field exerts on the atom,
F(r) = hF̂(r)i = −Trat ρ̂∇r Ĥint

Now, we let the atom be at the position r = 0,

F(0) = − 12 ~∇r Ω(0)(ρ12 e−ı∆t + ρ21 eı∆t ) − 2ı ~kΩ(0)(ρ12 e−ı∆t − ρ21 eı∆t ) . (19.19)
The quantities ρ12 ≡ h1|ρ̂|2i = ρ∗21 are the coherences, which develop in a twolevel system excited by a laser beam. Inserting the stationary solutions of the Bloch

The resonant cross section for a ’classical’ transition is σa0 = 3λ2 /2π.
Apparently, the force comprises two contributions. The dipolar gradient force can
be derived from a potential. It is proportional to the intensity gradient and can
be interpreted as resulting from absorption processes immediately followed by selfstimulated emission. Near resonance it is dispersive. Far from resonance it can be
approximated by,

The radiation pressure force is dissipative. Close to resonance it is absorbing. It is
proportional to the phase gradient and the only force exerted by plane waves. It
can be interpreted as resulting from absorption processes followed by spontaneous
emission. With Ω2 = σa0 ΓI/~ω we get a formula,

(19.24)

which describes the force as a product of the number of photons in the incident beam,
I/~ω, the absorption cross section, σa (∆), and the recoil momentum per photon, ~k.
γsct is the scattering rate. The dipole gradient force (and the associated potential) is

often used to spatially confine atoms, and the radiation pressure force is often used
to cool them down. Note that we still need to correct Eqs. (19.23) and (19.24) to
take into account the square of the average over the possible spatial orientations of
the transition matrix element d12 /3.
The saturation parameter,

and

(19.26)

Eq. (19.26) shows that the radiation pressure force ’saturates’ as s increases, and
is therefore limited by the spontaneous emission rate. The saturation parameter
essentially describes the relative importance of terms appearing in the denominator

616

CHAPTER 19. ATOMIC MOTION IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

of the line profile function for the light forces. The spontaneous emission rate is an
intrinsic property of the atom, proportional to the square of the atomic transition
dipole moment, whereas the square of the Rabi frequency is a function of the incident
laser intensity. If s  1, the spontaneous emission is fast compared to any stimulated
process, and the light field is said to be weak. If s  1, the Rabi oscillation is fast
compared to spontaneous emission and the field is considered as strong. √The line
profile factor indicates a ’power broadening’ by saturation of a factor of 2. Note
that the dipolar gradient force and potential, Eqs. (19.26), do not saturate when the
intensity of the light field is increased. Usually Fdp and Udp are used to manipulate
and trap atoms in a laser beam tuned far away from resonance in order to avoid
absorption.
Often, the transition moment can be oriented using circularly polarized light. In
this case, all previous expressions for Fdp , Frp , and Udp should be multiplied by 3.
From now on we will abandon the average over the orientations and only use d212 for
the square of the transition dipole moment. Solve Excs. 19.2.5.1 and 19.2.5.2.

19.2.2

Semiclassical calculation of dipole force and radiative
pressure

In quantum mechanics we calculate the force from the Heisenberg equation [241],
F̂ =

p̂ = [Ĥ, p̂] = −∇r Ĥint .

(19.27)

Thus, the force is given by the gradient of the interaction energy between the atom
and the light field. Within the dipole approximation the interaction energy is given
~
by d · E(r).
The force is now,

≡ FC (r) + FL (r) .

The first contribution can be interpreted as the Coulomb force acting on the
electron performing rapid oscillations at the position r(t) = r0 + e−1 P(r0 , t). The
second term is the time-averaged Lorentz force acting on the oscillating electric dipolar
moment [287, 290, 288],

Force exerted by a quantized radiation field

Photons carry one unit of momentum p = ~k, which they transfer to the atom during
an absorption or emission process. That is, the light exerts a recoil on the atoms.

this they calculate the force and establish a Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner
function.

19.2.4

Refraction of atoms by light and of light by atoms

Non-resonant light acts on theR external degrees of freedom of atoms by a phase shift
of the Broglie wave, exp i~−1 U (r, t)dt , and simultaneously on the internal degrees
of freedom by a dynamic Stark shift or light shift of the energy levels by the value of
U (r). The Bloch vector defined by,
 1

√ cg c∗
e



ρ ≡  √12 c∗g ce 
(19.33)
|ce |2 − |cg |2

describes, under the influence of the dispersive interaction, a precession around the
polar axis. This was discussed in Exc. 14.5.5.7. The Stark shift causes a rotation
of ~−1 U (r)t. Simultaneously, the atom is subjected to a force, which corresponds to
the gradient of the potential −∇U (r), as illustrated in Fig. 19.4(a). We see that the
phase shifts of the Broglie wave and the Bloch vector are equal. Finally, the light
mode phase is also shifted by the same amount in an effect called refraction. That is,
the internal, external, and optical degrees of freedom are entangled.
This fact has a practical use in atomic interferometers, because it is often easier
to detect an interference of internal excitation states rather than of Broglie waves.
Because of the entanglement, it is sufficient to measure one interference pattern to
know the other one.
By local variations of the potential U (r), e.g. induced by a focused laser beam,
it is possible to manipulate a Broglie wavefront in the same way that, in classical
optics, we manipulate the wavefront of a light beam by lenses or other objects, such
as for instance, the refractive index represented by an atomic cloud near resonance,
as illustrated in Fig. 19.4(b).
The orientation of the force depends on the light frequency as compared to the
resonant frequency. The dipolar force attracts the atom to regions where the light field

Figure 19.4: Diagram (a) shows product states and dressed states for blue detuning. Note
that the population is in the upper level and that the atom is subject to a repulsive weak field

is strong, when the frequency is tuned below ω0 , and it attracts the atom to regions
of weak fields, when tuned above ω0 . Integration over the relevant spatial coordinates
results in an effective potential or barrier to the atom. The qualitative behavior of
the dipolar potential and its effect on the motion of atoms is easily visualized in the
dressed states picture. Fig. 19.5 shows what happens when an atom enters a well
defined region of an optical field, for example a focused laser beam.

Figure 19.5: Analogy between light optics and atomic optics.

Outside the atom-dipole coupling zone the expression ~Ω is despicable and the
’dressed states’ are just the atom-field product states. When the atom enters the
field, this expression becomes nonzero and the atom-field states combine to produce
a set of dressed states. The energy levels of the product states ’repel’ each other and
approach the dressed states levels. Assuming that the laser is sufficiently detuned to
maintain the absorption rate negligible, the population remains in the ground state.
We see that blue (red) detuning leads to a repulsive (attractive) potential for atoms
remaining in the grounded state. In addition, since ~Ω is directly proportional to the
root of the laser intensity, an increase in that intensity (optical power per unit area)
obviously amplifies the force on the atom (F ' ∇R Ω).

19.3

Photonic recoil on free and confined atoms

A trap confining the atomic motion can dramatically modify the way in which they
interact with light 5 . For instance, a trapping potential may alter the scattering rate,
the scattering angle, and the transfer of photonic recoil. However, potentials do not
exist in microscopic reality, not more than friction forces do. What exists, as we learn
in electrodynamics, are electromagnetic fields exerting Coulomb and Lorentz forces.
When we write down the Hamiltonian Ĥ = p2 /2m + V (r) in quantum mechanics, we
already make an important approximation, because the potential V (r) is an artifact
obtained by tracing over all those degrees of freedom, which are necessary to generate
a force field that can be approximated by a conservative potential.
In the great majority of situations, the approximation is very good. Problems may
however arise, when the momentum conservation comes into play, which is the case
e.g. of light scattering from ultracold atoms being accelerated by the photonic recoil
and shifting the scattered light via the Doppler effect. We then have to address the
issue of photonic recoil conserving (or not) the momentum.
Let us begin with a recapitulation of the classical picture of the scattering process applying the rules of energy and momentum conservation to the elastic collision
between a free atom and a photon. This process is known as Compton scattering.

19.3.1

Recoil- and Doppler-shift in classical mechanics

In classical mechanics we speak of elastic scattering when no energy is transferred
to internal degrees of freedom of the collision partners, so that kinetic energy and
momentum stay conserved. This concept can be transferred to quantum particles
(e.g. atoms) and photons. In elastic Compton scattering, if the atoms keep their
initial internal excitation, the law of momentum conservation requires the transfer of
photonic momentum to the scattering atom which, consequently, changes its kinetic
energy. To compensate for this kinetic energy change, the frequency of the scattered
light must change in order to preserve the total energy, as illustrated in Fig. 19.6(b).
We will calculate in the following the frequency distribution of the light scattered
by an atom as a function of its initial velocity p1 , of the frequency ω1 of the incident
5 The interaction also depends on other parameters, such as the geometry of the confinement
potential and on cooperative effects (bosonic stimulation), but this will be discussed later.

ω2 − ω1 = 2ωrec (−1 + cos ϑ) + k1 v1 (cos ϑout + cos ϑin ) ,

(19.39)

with p1 = mv1 . The first term describes the recoil shift and the second term the
Doppler shift.
The second term vanishes for initially at resting atoms, p1 = 0, and Eq. (19.39)
simplifies to,
ω2 − ω1 = 2ωrec (−1 + cos ϑ) .

621

It also vanishes for atoms which have no velocity component in the scattering plane
spanned by the wavevectors k1 and k2 , that is ϑout = 180◦ − ϑin 6 , for which case we
get the maximum recoil shift,
ω2 − ω1 = −4ωrec .

(19.41)

The recoil shift is a consequence of momentum conservation.
The recoil shift is typically on the order of ω2 − ω1 ≈ (2π) 10 kHz, which in many
situations is negligible (e.g. when we deal with thermal atomic clouds), such that we
can consider the scattering as elastic., i.e. the first term can be disregarded. Considering, for simplicity, only backscattering, cos ϑout = cos ϑin = 1, then Eq. (19.39)
simplifies to,
ω2 − ω1 = 2k1 v1 .

(19.42)

Obviously, the frequency shift depends on the initial velocity through the Doppler
shift k1 v1 . In a thermal gas, the velocities are distributed according to the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution. Therefore, Rayleigh scattering of light off a cloud of free
thermal atoms is subject to Doppler broadening 7 .

19.3.2

Kicking a free atom

A conceptual difficulty arises from the incompatibility of scattering picture (generally
described in homogeneous space with momentum conservation) and the trapping picture (when it is described in inhomogeneous space without momentum conservation).
The difficulty can be avoided by separating the processes into a ’kick’ followed by a
harmonic oscillation, for which we have to calculate the time-dependence of the states
and the observables. We will leave the discussion of such a scattering process to 19.3.3
and for the time being just focus on the time evolution of a harmonic oscillator that
just received a kick.
By a ’kicking’ an atom we denote a change of momentum within an arbitrarily
short amount of time. The shorter the kick-time the larger is, according to Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation, the spectrum of possible kinetic energies that can be
reached by the kick (see Sec. 6.4.3). However, the spectrum is restricted by the
free-particle dispersion relation, as illustrated in Fig. 19.6(a).
The kick is not a realistic physical concept, as it corresponds to an infinitely
strong and infinitely short force 8 . In a microscopic scattering process it assumes an
infinitely heavy collision partner, while we are more interested in photon scattering.
Consequently, in this case the spectrum of reachable energies is determined by the
frequency of the photon and the free-particle dispersion relation. We will now turn
our attention to the (Compton-)scattering of light by free atoms.
6 This

situation is often realized in Bragg scattering from optical lattices [579, 581, 580].
Doppler broadening is explored e.g. in RIR spectroscopy, where the momentum distribution
in p1 reveals as a frequency distribution ∆ω = ω2 − ω1 of Bragg-scattered light, which can be
measured by beating with an irradiated idler mode, which can be chosen as being identical to k2 .
8 which is what allows us to write down a potential
7 This

CHAPTER 19. ATOMIC MOTION IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

(In-)elastic light scattering from a single weakly or strongly
confined atom

We mentioned in the last subsection that a scattering process is elastic when none of
the collision partners changes its internal excitation energy. The situation becomes,
however, more complex when one of the collision partners is confined in a potential,
as we will show in the following.
19.3.3.1

Cooperativity in light scattering

In light scattering cooperativity means breaking of the isotropic symmetry for the
angular distribution of scattered modes. In this sense, the anisotropic scattering
from an atom confined in an anisotropic trap is cooperative. But there are other
cooperative scattering effects messing with isotropy and shaping the density-of-states,
like the Purcell effect in the presence of an optical cavity or a photonic band gap
concentrating optical modes in a specific solid angles [282]. Another cooperative effect,
which is observed in the presence of other atoms, has to do with bosonic stimulation
by the optical output mode (as in Bragg scattering [579, 581, 580]) or the momentum
sidemode (as in stimulated matter wave 4WM). These effects, which all need to be
considered in calculations of the static structure factor ruling the scattering of light,
are often strong enough to hide the role of an anisotropic trapping potential. In the
following subsections we will disregard all these effects and concentrate on a single
trapped atom.
The simple picture of Compton scattering presented in Sec. 19.3.1 holds for free
atoms, whose dynamics is totally understood in terms of their internal electronic
p2
excitation (Ĥele ), the kinetic energy of their center-of-mass (Ĥcm = 2m
), the radiation
field (Ĥrad ) (which may be treated classically under the circumstances discussed here),
and the coupling (Ĥint ) of all three degrees of freedom,
Ĥf ree = Ĥele + Ĥcm + Ĥrad + Ĥint .

(19.43)

Transition probabilities are readily calculated using Fermi’s Golden rule, because
the density-of-states distributions for the final radiation modes receiving the scattered photons (photonic density-of-states) and the recoil modes receiving the scattered atoms (phononic density-of-states) are white, that is, without resonances, and
isotropic.
In the presence of an imposed trapping potential, an additional term appears
in the Hamiltonian, which has the capacity of dramatically changing the scattering
features,

The confining potential may or may not depend on the internal state of the atom.

where ω0 is the frequency of the atomic transition. In the following, however, we will
treat potentials that are independent of the internal atomic state.
19.3.3.2

Resolved sideband regime

As discussed in Sec. 14.4.5, incident light is absorbed by an atom harmonically oscillating in a trap with frequency ωtrp on a spectrum of discrete sidebands separated
by ωtrp with amplitudes given by Jn (kv0 /ωtrp ). The modulation index kv0 /ωtrp =
kx0 = 2πx0 /λ corresponds to the Lamb-Dicke parameter. When the modulation amplitude is within the so-called Lamb-Dicke regime, kv0  ωtrp , the first sidebands
become smaller than the carrier, J1 (kv0 /ωtrp ) < J0 (kv0 /ωtrp ) and, therefore, do not
contribute to the Doppler width of the frequency distribution. That is, the linear
Doppler effect vanishes.

and unresolved sidebands (blue curve) and resolved sidebands (red curve), and (b) strong

The Mößbauer effect

The role of photonic recoil in the scattering of light by confined atoms has been
unraveled by Mößbauer, who performed scattering experiments of γ-photons on a 57 Fe
crystal on a narrow transition of this isotope at 14 keV (0.086 nm). The linewidth
of this transition, Γ ≈ (2π) 1 MHz, is much narrower than the recoil-shift, ωrec ≈
(2π) 500 MHz  Γ, so that we should expect the scattered light to be considerably
recoil-shifted and Doppler-broadened. In fact, the recoil-shift should be so large, that
scattered photons cannot be reabsorbed by other atoms on this transition being at
rest. This is not what Mößbauer observed in his experiments. He found that scattered
photons can be reused for subsequent scattering, which means that the scattering must
be elastic.
The explanation for this unexpected observation is that, if the nucleus is embedded
in a crystal, the vibrational frequencies, which are even higher than the photonic recoil

624

CHAPTER 19. ATOMIC MOTION IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

frequency, ωtrp ≈ 2π · 3 THz, are unreachable. That is to say, we are in the resolved
sidebands Lamb-Dicke regime, ωtrp  ωrec  Γ. Here, the phonons corresponding
to the vibrations cannot be excited, so that the recoil momentum must be absorbed
by the whole lattice, whose entire mass is so large, that the photon frequency is not
recoil-shifted by the scattering process. Hence, the first-order Doppler effect is avoided
and the measured width of the transition is just the natural linewidth. Furthermore,
the atom remains in the same vibrational state of their localizing potential. This is
the Mößbauer effect.

A similar effect can be observed with trapped atoms driven on very narrow transitions, as we will discuss in the following.

19.3.3.4

Coupling of internal and external motion by photonic recoil,
tracing over the internal excitation

When discussing the transfer of momentum to a harmonic oscillator in 3.6.2, we did
not say how the momentum shift could be realized in practice. As we have seen in
the example of the Mößbauer effect, a possible way is via the photonic recoil received
on a light scattering process. The coupling of the relevant degrees of freedom of the
system induced by the absorption of a photon by an atom is accounted for by an
additional interaction term Ĥint in the Hamiltonian. The relevant degrees of freedom
are the electronic orbital |ii, the vibrational state |ni, and the number of photons |N i
~ t) = E0 êy eıkz z−ıωt . Neglecting the
in the light mode, assumed to be a plane wave E(r,
quantum nature of the light, we will disregard this degree of freedom in the following.
Assuming that the trapping potential is the same for all electronic orbitals, as in
(19.45), the total state can be expressed as a product state, |n, ii ≡ |ii ⊗ |ni. The

So, vibrational states are only coupled via electronic transitions,

and

Hence, we have to span the complete Hilbert space of all operators like σ̂ † =

The fact that only terms proportional to hn|eikẑ |mi contribute can be understood
in terms of the Franck-Condon overlap between the vibrational states to be coupled.
And the fact that the energy of the harmonic oscillator, and thus the effective detuning
∆n ≡ ω − ω0 − ωtrp (n + 21 ), depend on the vibrational state couples the internal and
the external dynamics.
Nevertheless, the off-diagonal coupling elements only contain the degrees of freedom of the harmonic oscillator.
19.3.3.5

Momentum kick by photonic recoil

We said earlier that a momentum kick can drive an atom from the vibrational ground
state |0i into a coherent superposition of states |αi, except when the Lamb-Dicke
parameter is very small. When the kick is realized via photonic recoil, e.g. when an
electronically excited atom decays to the ground state, the frequency of the emitted
photon depends on the final vibrational state of the atom. That is we expect a
coherent superposition of light frequencies, which in the limit η > 1 generates a
Doppler broadening and in the limit η < 1 stays unshifted as for elastic scattering.
9 Note,

that this Hamiltonian cannot be used to describe spontaneous emission. To do so, we need
to allow for 3D systems and decay modes,

Let us now consider a single confined atom and address the question of the absorption probability. In first-order perturbation, using the Hamiltonian (19.47), the

The interpretation of this result is that the absorption of a photon by an atom in

superposition state. Inversely, for the emission process from state |0, ei within the
Lamb-Dicke regime, most of the time we will encounter the emitted photon at the
resonance frequency ω0 , and rarely at ω0 − ωtrp . In any case, energy conservation is
satisfied, since,

A single anisotropically trapped atom in first-order perturbation

Let us now consider a single atom (e.g. a trapped ion) confined in an 3-dimensional
anisotropic trap (e.g. strong confinement in one and weak confinement in the other
direction) and address the question, whether the scattering will be anisotropic, as well.
We generalize the problem to three
P dimensions by allowing for quantized vibrational
states in three dimensions, σ̂ † = n |nihn| ⊗ |eihg| with |ni = |nx , ny , nz i.

Collective Scattering of Light

Chapter 20

Cooperativity in light
scattering
In Chp. 14.6.1 we discussed the interaction of light with individual atoms. In the practice of spectroscopy, however, we often work with ensembles of scatterers. Depending
on their spatial distribution (e.g. disordered, quasi-continuous, periodic), their motion
(hot gas or cold cloud), the possible existence of correlations between them, the presence of boundary conditions (e.g., free space, cavities, or photon bands), and finally, in
case of degenerate quantum gases, of a possible bosonic stimulation of the scattering
process, we expect new collective effects. In this chapter we will discuss several examples, in particular, localization effects induced by disorder, super- and subradiance,
Bragg scattering, and the formation of forbidden photonic bands in periodic lattices.
Phenomena leading to self-organization, such as the collective atomic recoil laser, will
be discussed in Chp. 22.6.1.

Atomic cloud as a bulk object characterized by a refraction index n(r). (c) Illustration of a
photonic band in an optical lattice.

This chapter starts with introducing as the main theoretical tools the structure
factor and the coupled dipoles model. In Sec. 20.1 we will derive the formalism and
learn, how to employ it to calculate, e.g. the spatial distribution of light scattered by
an atomic cloud and the radiation pressure force on the atoms focusing on situations,
where interatomic interactions induced by the incident light can be neglected. In
Sec. 20.2 we will, disregarding the atomic’s cloud graininess and disorder, introduce
the smooth density approximation and compare it to macroscopic Mie scattering.
In Sec. 20.3 we will focus on cooperative effects inducing collective lineshifts and
broadenings, such as the Lorentz-Lorenz and the Lamb shift. We will also discuss
disorder-induced localization effects, super- and subradiance. In Sec. 20.2 we investi631

632

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING

gate Bragg scattering, i.e. scattering from periodically ordered atoms, and finally in
Sec. 21.2 we study scattering from correlated atoms.

20.1

Theoretical tools and models

As mentioned above, the process of light scattering by an atomic cloud depends on
several factors, many of which can be summarized by a quantity called the structure
factor. This structure factor, obtained in perturbation theory, describes the probability for the light to be scattered into a particular direction as a function of the
properties of the atomic cloud (spatial distribution, motion, etc.). The quantity is
well suited for dealing with stationary situations.
On the other hand we have at our disposal a microscopic theory called the coupled dipole model. In this model we treat every individual atom as a dipole, which
interacts with all other atoms by rescattering the incident light. The resolution of the
Schrödinger equation allows, several approximations having been made, to calculate
the dynamics of the system.

20.1.1

The structure factor and definition of cooperativity

One way of characterizing the scattering process is by structure factor. The static
structure factor is the normalized response of a system to a perturbation with the
wave vector q. It can be understood as the final density of states for the atom after
the scattering process. In contrast, the dynamic structure factor also considers the
final density of states for the emitted or scattered photon. That is, on one hand, the
frequency and momentum of the photon must satisfy the Bragg condition. On the
other hand, the density of available states can also be structured, for example, when
the scattering process takes place inside a cavity.
In lowest-order perturbation theory (Fermi’s Golden Rule) we get the general
expressions [350],

the density-density correlation function. On the other hand, eıωt dω = 2πδ(t), and
we calculate the static structure factor,
S(q) ≡

Z

S(q, ω)dω = hρ̂(q, 0)ρ̂† (q, 0)i .

(20.4)

20.1. THEORETICAL TOOLS AND MODELS

633

In the equations (20.2) and (20.3) we have written the quantities ρ̂(q, t) and n̂(r, t)
as operators, in order to allow for the possibility, that the atomic ensemble is a
quantum gas, i.e. a Bose-Einstein condensate characterized by a single wavefunction
ψ̂(r, t) normalized to the density distribution, ρ̂(r, t) = ψ̂ † (r, t)ψ̂(r, t). We shall return
to this subject in Sec. 28.1.1. In the following, we will restrict ourselves to atoms
localized in space with well-defined velocities and calculate the structure factor (i) for
disordered clouds of atoms excited by the passage of a photon in Sec. 20.1.6 and
(ii) for Bragg scattering by optical lattices in Sec. 20.4. In these cases, we find in the
literature often another definition of the structure factor as the expectation value of
the Fourier transform of the atomic density,
F (q) = hρ̂(q)i ,

(20.5)

Thus, it describes the amplitude of the electric field of the scattered radiation. We
study the structure factor for various atomic density distributions in Excs. 20.1.8.1
to 20.1.8.3.
Example 80 (Structure
factor of a discrete cloud ): In case of discrete
P
clouds, n(r, t) = j δ (3) (r − rj ), we can disregard the quantum nature of the
operators. The relationship (20.3) immediately gives,

That is, without recoil the light must be scattered elastically.

Cooperativity is defined as any deviation of the structure factor from isotropy .
For example, Bragg scattering and optical cavities are highly cooperative, because
they favor scattering in particular directions 1 .

20.1.2

The scalar coupled dipoles model

In the following, we develop the coupled dipoles model, within which we define the
structure factor for light scattering by a cloud of scatterers making the following
assumptions:
 The light is (mostly) treated as a scalar field. That is, we disregard effects due
to the polarization of light and assume two-level atoms. Generalizations are
shown in Sec. 20.5.4 [576, 411].
1 Note that cooperativity does not request the atoms to interact and exists in the single scattering
regime. In the multiple scattering regime other forms of collective phenomena, such as collective
Lamb shifts emerge, as we will see later on.

634

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING
 Atoms are supposed to be fixed in space. That is, we disregard the Doppler shift
of moving atoms and the photonic recoil. Therefore, it will suffice to consider
the static structure factor.
 Atoms are initially uncorrelated and not degenerate. That means that we neglect effects such as bosonic stimulation or Fermi blocking 2 .

Be ω0 the frequency of the incident light, ωa the frequency of the atomic resonance,
and ω the frequency of the scattered light. The Hamiltonian is nothing more than
the generalization of (15.105) to several assumed atoms located at the positions rj ,

the incident light (which is treated as a classical field with n0 photons), σ̂j is the

operator for the j-th atom, âk is the photon annihilation operator, and
p
gk = d ω/(~0 Vph ) describes the coupling between the atom and the vacuum modes
the volume of which is Vph . The j-th atom has its lower and upper states denoted by
|gj i and |ej i, respectively. That is, we treat the atoms as simple two-level systems.
We also assume that all atoms are excited by the same unperturbed incident laser
beam, thus neglecting their dephasing along the laser path or induced by near-field
effects (which could arise for large spatial densities).
Within the rotating wave approximation RWA the Hamiltonian simplifies to,

The RWA only considers energy-conserving terms in single-photon processes. But
this is an artifact from the field quantization. Energy conservation can be warranted
by considering multi-photon virtual processes, which as a whole, conserve energy.
These terms appear in the full Hamiltonian, but are neglected in the RWA. While the
RWA often is a good assumption in single atom quantum optics, this is frequently
not the case for collective scattering. Here, we adopt the RWA to a simplify the
subsequent solution of the Schrödinger equation, but we will need to generalize the
results obtained a posteriori, as shown in the discussion of Sec. 20.1.4.
We call |0ia = |g1 , .., gN i the atomic ground state, |jia = |g1 , .., ej , .., gN i the
state where only the atom j is excited, and we assume that the system is in a the

With this ansatz we imply that at every instant of time, there can be at most only
one excitation in the atomic cloud. The temporal evolution of the amplitudes is
obtained by inserting the Hamiltonian and the ansatz into the Schrödinger equation,
ı~∂t |Ψ(t)i = Ĥ|Ψ(t)i. Once the evolution of the amplitudes is calculated, we can
determine the observables of the system, such as the radiative pressure force or the
amplitudes of the scattered radiation fields or the fields inside the cloud.

The Markov approximation

For small systems, R < λ, we can make use of the Markov approximation, which holds

The whole expression leads to the exponential kernel, the first two terms are the
cosine part, the third term is the sine part. The rotating wave approximation consists
in neglecting the first term, i.e. it only concerns the cosine part of the kernel.

(20.29)

There has been a controversy between Friedberg and Scully about the role of
virtual photons (or collective Lamb-shift) [221, 608, 222, 563]. These terms result
from counterrotating terms in the rotating wave approximation. Scully assumes timed
Dicke states in infinitely large clouds and finds the contributions weak. Friedberg
does a mode expansion of the cloud and finds that different modes decay at different
velocities. This yields time-dependent radiation patterns, which can be temporarily
larger in backward direction.
Normally, the RWA is a good approximation, when Ω  ω. Deviations from this
approximations lead e.g. to the Bloch-Siegert shift and important corrections for very
far-detuned (quasi-electrostatic) optical trapping.
The above requirement is not well
√
satisfied for our experiment, since ΩN = N Ω ' 1..10 THz.
Be |b1 b2 ...aj ...bN i the state with all atoms in the ground state except atom j being
in the excited state. Hence, the cloud’s state is simply expressed by the wavefunction,
Ψatom (t) =

N
X
j=1

βj (t)|b1 b2 ...aj ...bN i .

(20.30)

For large σ the radiation pressure is independent on the choice of the kernel.
In fact we may even set the kernel to 0. For small σ there appears a considerable
deviation. Interestingly, the imaginary part of the kernel gets important for higher
densities, even when the optical density is maintained, e.g. by compressing the cloud
in z-direction. This means that the collective Lamb shift becomes more apparent is
small compressed clouds. But we postpone a more thorough discussion to Sec. 20.3.
The analytic expansion into eigenmodes assumes the RWA. Hence, the numerics
deviate from the analytics for small σ and large N . Is it possible to generalize the
expansion to the exponential kernel (see [609])? The authors also suggest that the
scattered radiation be frequency-shifted due to the imaginary part of the kernel. This
might be an interesting observable for experiments.
20.1.4.1

Low collective saturation

Note that for low saturation, α(t) = 1, the first term simply becomes − 2ı Ω0 . Even
though the single atom excitation
rate may be small in case of large detuning, the
√
collective Rabi frequency N Ω can be large. The presence of many excitations in

they are included in the Hamiltonian when the RWA is NOT applied.
6 Note that Maxwell’s equations contain non-RWA terms.

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING

the cloud means, that higher Dicke states are populated. Then we may expect a
complicated many-body dynamics, if decay into other states than the timed Dicke
state is possible.
Even though the single atom
√ excitation rate may be small in case of large detuning,
the collective Rabi frequency N Ω can be large. The presence of many excitations
in the cloud means, that higher Dicke states are populated. Then we may expect a
complicated many-body dynamics, if decay into other states than the timed Dicke
state is possible.
The model we use (ground state + first excited state in the times Dicke basis) does
not allow more than 1 photon for N atoms. For such a model, neglecting saturation
means ’much’ less than 1 atom in the excited state, i.e. the probability of having the
any atom in the excited state is less than 1. But having N atoms, this means that
each atoms should have a excited state population of much less than 1/N . Including
the saturation in the naive way, means that when this term N Ω20 is not negligible,
than we will have less atoms in the first excited state of the timed Dicke basis, than
if when we would neglect saturation. This is precisely why we call this saturation,
we cannot take more atoms away from the ground state, because the system cannot
absorb more than one photon. But when this term is not longer negligible, then
in a cloud of N atoms, this does not prevent us from taking atoms away from the
ground state (we have N atoms which each can take one photon). Either the term is
negligible (and we could drop it) or we will try to keep its contribution (even at first
order in N Ω20 ), but then we cannot neglect the possibility of having 2 atoms excited.
20.1.4.2

Steady-state solution

In steady-state the equations of the coupled dipoles model can be solved numerically
for an arbitrary (ordered or disordered) cloud of immobile atoms located at positions
rj illuminated by an electric field.
Assuming scalar light and the validity of the Markov approximation, and furthermore defining β̄j ≡ β̃j eık0 ·rj and Ω̄0 (rj ) ≡ Ω0 (rj )eık0 ·rj , and using the exponential
kernel,
eık0 |rj −rm |

In this form the solution is immediately suitable for numerical implementation of
the coupled dipoles model, although in practice the number of atoms is limited to
N < 10000 for ordinary PCs.

As long as the RWA and the Markov approximation are valid and only the lowest
Dicke state is considered (no collective saturation), this simulation is supposed to be
exact and contains all the physics including, e.g. multiple scattering. Fig. 20.5 shows
a comparison of the cases when the off-diagonal components of the kernel (20.37)
are present or not. Apparently, the presence of rescattering dramatically spoils the
radiation pressure force, a phenomenon that we will extensively study in Secs. 20.1.7
and 20.2 [217, 27, 28, 491, 61, 29].

20.1.7

The structure factor of the ’timed’ Dicke state

When a beam of light passes through an atomic cloud, its phase fronts will excite the
atomic dipole moments as it traverses the cloud. That is, understanding the beam
as a plane wave eı(k0 ·r−ωt) , the dipoles start to oscillate with relative phase delays
eık0 ·(rj −rm ) depending on their position along the optical axis k0 . The resulting
collective state has been termed timed Dicke state [564]. Assuming that this phase
delay is the only parameter distinguishing two atoms, we may write with Eq. (20.17),
1
β̃j (t) = βj (t)eı(∆0 t−k0 ·rj ) ≡ √ β(t) ,
N

(20.64)

where β is the macroscopic dipole moment. Note, that the fact that β(t) does not
depend on the atomic position does not imply a continuous density distribution. The
atoms are still sitting at their positions rj ; only are their dipole moments synchronized
to the incident light wave.
The assumption of a timed Dicke state for the atomic cloud is, nevertheless, an
approximation which is not always good [217]. For example, it neglects dispersive
phase shifts of the excitation of the atomic dipole moments by the pump laser beam

20.1. THEORETICAL TOOLS AND MODELS

being delayed on its propagation due to its interaction with the atoms. If such phase
shifts (and absorption as well) are radially inhomogeneous, this can lead to deformation of the pump laser beam’s phase front and thus to lensing. We will discuss this
in Exc. 20.1.8.5 and in Sec. 20.2.

The evolution of the cloud very much depends on the initial conditions, e.g. βj (0) = 1
for the uniformly excited symmetric state βj (0) = eık0 ·rj for timed Dicke states.

It basically tells the angular distribution of the scattered light. Fig. 20.6 shows numerical calculations and analytical approximations of the structure factor for various
shapes and sizes of the atomic cloud. Obviously, the radiation pattern very much
depends on the size of the spherical cloud. For R < λ it is isotropic, for R > λ
scattering mainly occurs in forward direction. Furthermore, if the cloud is ellipsoidal
the radiation pattern is shifted into forward direction.

For such a cloud the structure factor is SN = N −1/2 . Note that this is unlike N
atoms in the Dicke limit, where SN = 1.
A dense homogeneous cloud with SN (k) ∝ δ 3 (k0 − k) does not scatter light and
experiences no force, hFhom i = 0. This is however not true any more in the limit of
small extended clouds, where fluctuations introduce disorder. This can be shown by
simulating a random atomic distribution rj and integrating the resulting force over all
possible k. For simplicity we assume a very sharp momentum distribution, |k| = |k0 |

The interpretation is the following. In the experimentally realized situation, we
are very far in the large cloud limit completely dominated by forward scattering,
which means that if the cloud were homogeneous no radiation pressure force should
be expected at all. However diffuse scattering from disordered atoms (or fluctuations)
disturbs the forward scattering. It is this scattering which gives rise to radiation
pressure.
There is an interesting analogy: Diffuse scattering not only inhibits forward scattering in homogeneous clouds, but also coherent backscattering from ordered structures. E.g. in optical lattices [580] it disturbs the detection of photonic band gaps.
In an optical lattice the atoms are in the Dicke limit and do not absorb photonic recoil. Hence, no displacement due to radiation pressure is expected. However, diffuse
scattering is observed as absorptive features in the spectra [64, 580].
The Bragg scattering is expressed by a periodic structure factor. A widely used
approach to describe the impact of disordered atoms in lattices is to divide the cloud
into a perfectly ordered part with density nfDW and isotropically scattering part
with density n(1 − fDW ) [580]. The factor fDW is known as Debye-Waller factor.
In Exc. 20.1.8.7 we try an alternative traetment of radiation pressure based on a
Monte-Carlo simulation.

654
20.1.7.6

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING
Cooperative scattering and single photon superradiance

A non-isotropic structure factor scattering light into a specific direction of space
(e.g. the Bragg angle) at a rate scaling like N α with α > 1 needs several ’cooperating’
particles. In this sense cooperation only means, that the particles be arranged in space
in a particular way, i.e. in a lattice or in a particular bulk shape like a homogeneous
sphere or a Gaussian cigar-shaped density distribution. It also immediately becomes
clear that disorder ought to play a major role. However, cooperation goes further,
since cooperative scattering can be observed in spontaneous emission of an atomic
cloud being excited by just a single photon. Single-photon superradiance is the topic
of the following sections.
For now let us state that a non-isotropic structure factor results in collective
scattering. The density distribution (which is the Fourier transform of the structure
factor) can adopt two extremes: A periodic lattice results in backscattering into
specific directions, a homogeneous clouds shows nothing but forward scattering. Both
situations are never perfectly realized, but are subject to density fluctuations (DebyeWaller factor in a lattice, radiation pressure in a homogeneous cloud).
A single photon on its trip through an atomic cloud successively excites the atomic
dipole moment thus establishing a phase relation between potential radiators [193,
610, 563, 611]. One could think that the scattering process localizes atom and photon,
i.e. only one atom scatters. However, we don’t know which atom scatters, and this
introduces a correlation of the dipole moments along the propagation direction of the
light beam.

Figure 20.9: Scattering of a photon by an atom of an ellipsoidal cloud.

While normally the radiation rate of a dilute cloud is ∝ N , in the presence of
coherent interactions it scales as ∝ N 2 . Coherent interactions are not conditioned to
overlapping space functions of the atoms, i.e. it is not compulsory that the density
be n−1/3 > λ. For example, scattering from ordered structures also scales as ∝ N 2
[338]. However, the scattering will be dramatically different if n−1/3 < λ.
Spontaneous emission radiation pattern from uncorrelated scatterers only depend
~ but not on the k-vector of the incident light.
on the relative orientation of σ̂ and B,
This also holds for Dicke superradiance in the small cloud limit, but not for large
clouds. Here forward scattering dominates.
We have seen in this section that, despite its simplicity, the coupled dipoles model
has a large range of applications. It allows for a deeper understanding of known classical phenomena and, as we will study in Excs. 20.1.8.8 to 20.1.8.10 and in forthcoming
sections, it allows to unravel new effects.

Ex: Monte-Carlo simulation of cooperative radiation pressure

In a regime of negligible interatomic interaction single photons are scattered by individual atoms, which thereby receive the entire photonic recoil. That is, the acceleration occurs in quantized steps, which can be easily resolved in experiments [313, 578]
with Bose-Einstein condensates. In the absence of collective effects, we generally
observe halo-shaped momentum distributions. Because of the recoil received upon
absorption, the halos are centered at ~k, and since the emission is generally isotropic,
they have a radius of ~k. On the other hand, as we have seen earlier, cooperative
effects can suppression radiation pressure. In the following we try a different approach

656

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING

based on a Monte-Carlo simulation with a Langevin force.
This approach starts from the idea that it is possible to simulate the radiation pressure without explicit calculation of the force by treating the scattering process as a
Langevin force. The simulation describes the scattering of single photons by individual atoms. Cooperativity is included 1. in the scattering rate, which is influenced by
collective effects, 2. by weighing the probability for the direction (θ, φ) into which the
photons are scattered with the structure factor. The enhancement of the collective
scattering rate corresponds to the rate of absorption part of the radiation pressure,

Discuss whether the coupled dipoles model can be extended to provide a microscopic description of gaseous metamaterials (negative refractive index) and the GoosHänchen, Imbert-Fedorov, Spin-Hall, and Ewald-Oseen effects, and interference with
a LO. Is it possible to check Ewald-Oseen’s theorem in media with negative refractive
index?

20.2

Continuous density distributions and Mie scattering

In the last sections we developed the coupled dipoles model describing light scattering
from ensembles of individual microscopic particles by a set of equations of motion,
in the simplest case, one for every atomic dipole. This limits the number of atoms
9 Note that in reality the scattering of a photon converts the scattering atom into a coherent
superposition of directions into which the atom might have scattered. This is of course not described
by the simulation.
10 Although the atomic motion is frozen, it is not correct to say that the external degree of freedom
is not involved in the collective dynamics, since the spatial atomic distribution shapes the structure
factor.

20.2. CONTINUOUS DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND MIE SCATTERING 657
that can be considered in numerical simulations to a few 1000. On the other hand,
most cold atom experiments nowadays are performed with 105 to 109 atoms. The
following section are devoted to introducing concepts and approximations allowing us
to understand light scattering from large atomic clouds.
The main step will consist in an approximation called smooth or continuous density
approximation, where the discrete distribution of point-like scatterers is replaced by
an inhomogeneous but smooth continuous density distribution characterized by a
refraction index field nrf r (r). The interaction of this density distribution with light is
then treated in the framework of Maxwell’s equations, i.e. inhomogeneities are treated
as macroscopic boundary conditions to the electromagnetic fields. In the following we
will term this regime as Mie scattering.
At first sight Rayleigh scattering from point-like particles and Mie scattering from
extended objects are quite different phenomena. Rayleigh scattering exhibits resonances due to the internal structure of the particles, e.g. an atom. Mie scattering
shows resonances induced by the boundary conditions the scattering objects impose
to the field. On the other hand, from a microscopic viewpoint, any extended object
(e.g. a dielectric sphere) is nothing but an assembly of microscopic scattering particles. The question we need to study is then whether a description of the diffraction
from this object as the sum of the radiation patterns scattered from the individual
constituent particles is correct; or in how far the graininess of the cloud’s density distribution and cooperative effects arising from the interaction between the individual
particles play a role [104].
Interesting phenomena are expected in the transition regime between the limits
of a dense bunch of individual scatterers and macroscopic dielectric objects. One of
them is a strong modification of the radiation pressure force [135], which can conveniently be studied with atomic ensembles. The reason is that, in the smooth density
approximation, the cloud can be understood as a macroscopic object characterized
by a refraction index, which can be tuned over huge ranges by changing the cloud’s
density and volume, or by tuning the frequency of the incident light exploiting the
existence of atomic resonances. We will see in the following that it is possible to study
radiation pressure with cold atoms in the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans limit of small phaseshifts, as well as in the Mie limit of large phase shifts [27]. Despite the absence of
sharp boundaries for the atomic cloud, we predict the occurrence of Mie resonances,
which could be detected experimentally [28].

20.2.1

Continuous density approximation

In light scattering experiments, disorder (or granularity) plays a role when the number
of atoms projected onto a cross section perpendicular to the incident beam is small
enough so that a light mode focused down to the diffraction limit (that is ∼ λ2 ) would
be able to resolve and count the atoms. In other words, the stochastic fluctuations
induced by the random positions of the atoms can be neglected when the total number
of atoms N is larger than the number of modes ∼ σ 2 that fit into the cloud’s cross
section, i.e. when the optical density is b0 = 3N/σ 2  1. Under this hypothesis, the
differential equation (20.26) for β̃j can be simplified by replacing the discrete sum

Radiation pressure force in macro- and microscopic scattering

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, scattering of light by an extended object such as an atomic ensemble or a dielectric sphere is fundamentally different from
scattering at a point-like scatterer such as a single atom. On one hand, the finite size
of the object leads to Mie scattering. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of
the scatterers rules the degree of cooperativity. Homogeneous and periodic distributions tend to scatter cooperatively, whereas disorder suppresses cooperativity. In an
atomic cloud, the amount of disorder can be tuned via the optical density seen by
the incident light, and its role can be studied via the radiation pressure exerted by
the light on the atomic cloud. We present an analytic expression for the radiation
pressure valid for any numbers of atoms and arbitrary density distributions, which interpolates between the regimes of dominating disorder and dominating cooperativity.
Furthermore, we present first experimental signatures of radiation pressure reduction
due to cooperative scattering.
The radiation pressure exerted by a plane wave laser beam with frequency ω0 and
wave vector k0 = k0 êz on a single two-level atom with resonance frequency ωa = ω0 −
∆0 is correctly described by the standard formula (20.80). Generalization to scattering
by atomic ensembles and extended objects is only possible, if a number of effects is
explicitly taken into account. The most important ones are named in the following.
a. Cooperativity and b. disorder : Cooperativity is the tendency of atoms located in the
same area of space, forming regular structures or being forced by the mode structure
of the environment (e.g. optical cavities) to scatter light synchronously into the same

20.2. CONTINUOUS DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND MIE SCATTERING 663
direction, as in the case of Dicke superradiance. While homogeneously or periodically
distributed atoms concentrate the scattered light in specific solid angles by forward
or Bragg scattering, randomly distributed atoms do not cooperate and scatter light
isotropically. In this respect, cooperativity and disorder are antagonists. c. Mie
scattering and refraction: The finite volume and the shape of the cloud represent
an inhomogeneity at which light is scattered in a global way. As long as the optical
density is low, the pump mode depletion is mainly due to the fact, that the atomic
cloud distorts the phase front of the incident light. For high optical density, scattering
is predominantly absorptive. d. Multiple scattering and e. resonance fluorescence:
Near resonance, multiple scattering leads to radiation trapping. Even off-resonance,
inelastic scattering pumps resonant photons into the atomic cloud, which have a high
probability to be reabsorbed. Taking account of all these effects, the real radiation
pressure can differ by orders of magnitude from the naive prediction of the above
formula.
For smooth density distributions Fc is only limited by Mie scattering at the inhomogeneity represented by the finite extend of the atomic cloud [135]. The radiation
pressure depends on the number of atoms N in the volume, and the scaling Fc (N )
depends on the pump laser detuning and the radial cross section of the cloud. But
small scale inhomogeneity within the cloud, i.e. disorder, can play an eminent role for
collective scattering. This is the case, when the number of atoms is beyond a critical
value, which mainly depends on the volume and shape of the cloud. In the following
we will derive an analytic expression for the radiation pressure as a function of atom
number, which interpolates between the regimes of dominating disorder (single-atom
Rayleigh scattering) and dominating cooperativity (pure Mie scattering).
On the other hand, we point out, that we do not consider multiple scattering in
our treatment. This is a good assumption far from resonance, where the scattering is
predominantly Rayleigh scattering and inelastic scattering can safely be disregarded.
In contrast, our extensions of single to multi-atom scattering are not valid near resonance.
The radiation pressure provides sensitive signatures for the impact of cooperativity
and disorder. We describe an experiment measuring the displacement of cold atoms
confined in a far-off resonance dipole trap and interpret our observations in terms of
collective scattering.

20.2.3.1

Radiation pressure for timed Dicke states

As a first approach we will calculate the radiation pressure for a timed Dicke state
from Eq. (20.89) by explicit analytical integration of the surface-integrated structure
factors s∞ and f∞ in the smooth density limit (20.96) for an ellipsoidal Gaussian
smooth density distribution, as shown in Exc. 20.2.5.2. In the spherical case,

Note that the radiation pressure calculated from Eq. (20.120) also holds for elongated
ellipsoidal Gaussian clouds characterized by an aspect ratio η > 1, even though the
expressions for the surface-integrated structure factors become more complicated.
It is revealing to compare the smooth density expressions (20.120) with numerical simulations based on randomly generated atomic distributions from which the
structure factor is directly from the sum (20.68). Interestingly, we find in certain parameter regimes (in particular at low atom numbers) considerable deviations between
sN , fN and s∞ , f∞ and consequently between the numerical simulations and the analytic calculations of the radiation pressure. We attribute these deviations to disorder
in the atomic cloud, which is not seen in the smooth density limit, but naturally
incorporated in the numerical approach.
By comparison to numerical simulations [black solid lines and blue circles in
Figs. 20.13(a)] we found that the surface-integrated structure factors in the presence
of disorder are well described by [62],

(20.121)

Cooperativity versus disorder

We expect disorder to play a dominant role, when the coarse graininess, which is
related to the average distance between two atoms, |ri − rj |, can be resolved by the
incident light. For the absorption process, this means that disorder gets important,
when the number of spatial modes supported by the pump laser in a radial cross
section of the atomic cloud,

Nca = s−1
(20.122)
∞ ' 4σ ,
(for voluminous clouds) surpasses the number of atoms, N < Nca . This is just the
case, when the mean resonant optical density (for a ray passing through the center of

Nca < Nce < Ncr , and we obtain the N -dependence of the radiation pressure depicted in Fig. 20.13.
In the regime N < Nca , radiation pressure is dominated by the absorption process,
sN  fN , because the emission is isotropic. The absorption radiation pressure exerted
on a hypothetical smooth density distribution occupying the same volume as the
atomic cloud [green line in Fig. 20.13] is dramatically reduced with respect to the
single-atom radiation pressure (cyan dash-dotted line). However, disorder suppresses
cooperativity and increases the radiation pressure up to the single-atom value. The
novelty as compared to Ref. [562] is the fact that cooperativity and disorder not only
influence the collective emission of a photon by an atomic cloud, but also the collective
absorption of a photon from a pump laser beam.
Neglecting the photon reemission at higher atom numbers would result in an increase of radiation pressure in the regime Nca < N < Nce (magenta line). However,
in this regime, the emission process becomes increasingly important, sN ' fN , because the emission changes its radiation pattern from isotropic to forward scattering.

666

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING

Consequently, the radiation pressure is reduced with respect to its purely absorptive
component. This regime is still ruled by disorder, so that the critical atom number
for the impact of disorder on the absorption process, Nca , has no impact. It does not
even show up in the formula (20.126).
In the regime Nce < N < Ncr , disorder steps back and cooperativity wins, so
that the radiation pressure approaches the smooth density limit. Since in this regime,
the smooth density radiation pressure depends on atom number like ∝ N , as already
shown in Ref. [135], we observe an increase of the radiation pressure beyond the singleatom value. This is only possible, because the collective enhancement of absorption
(magenta line) rises as fast with N , as the collective enhancement of emission.
For even higher atom numbers, Ncr < N , the radiation pressure dramatically
alters its N -dependency from ∝ N to ∝ N −1 . This change of behavior is not caused
by the interplay of cooperativity and disorder, but can be understood within the
framework of Mie scattering, as discussed in the next section.
20.2.3.3

Rayleigh-Debye-Gans versus Mie scattering

Radiation pressure is observed in many experiments, as it is the basis for optical
cooling techniques (like magneto-optical traps) and limits the efficiency of resonant
absorption imaging of cold atoms, because their acceleration leads to considerable
Doppler-shifts. However, as stated before, the impact of disorder on radiation pressure
can only be seen for large optical densities, b  1, which may partially explain, why
this effect has not been observed until two experiments explicitly searched for it
[62, 52] (see Fig. 20.14).

20.2. CONTINUOUS DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND MIE SCATTERING 667
Depending on the parameter regime chosen, the measurements exhibited in Fig. 20.14
present data for reduced or enhanced radiation pressure for larger N . As explained
above, the reduction is understood as microscopic Rayleigh scattering at disordered
atoms together with superradiant acceleration of the decay, while the enhancement
is observed when the bulk cloud becomes so small and dense that it turns into an
inhomogeneous dielectric sphere refracting and lensing incident light by macroscopic
Mie scattering.
The question then remains why the radiation pressure, with increasing N , after an
initial rise the drops again. To answer this question we must have a look at the phase
shift induced in the pumjp light by the cloud’s refraction index.. From calculations
done in Secs. 1.2.7 and 24.6.1 we know that (below saturation) the optical density b
and the phase shift ϕ are linked to the refraction index nrf r and the optical scattering

(20.129)

At high atom numbers (i.e. in the smooth density limit), the dependency of the radiation pressure on atom number (20.126) exhibits a maximum at Ncr . For an atomic
cloud with density n and the resonant optical density b0 , the characteristic atom number can be expressed in terms of the phase shift ϕ experienced by the pump laser beam
on its path across the cloud. Absorption losses for the pump beam (e.g. resonance
fluorescence, whose differential cross section contributes σopt to the total scattering
cross section [389]) is completely negligible at large detunings. Only elastic Rayleigh
scattering occurs, which in the smooth density limit of Mie scattering becomes pure
diffraction (real part of the refraction index). We can than understand the atomic
cloud as a non-absorbing dielectric sphere with a Gaussian index of refraction.

we see that, as long as ϕ < 12 , the force increases linearly like ∝ N . The proportionality comes from the perfect (in the sense of not spoiled by disorder) cooperative
enhancement of the scattering rate in the smooth density limit. The enhancement is
only limited by the finite size σ of the cloud, which is accounted for in the second

(20.131)

is termed the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans regime.
For larger phase shifts, ϕ > 21 , refraction more and more distorts the wavefront of
the pump beam, which spoils the pump mode depletion and hence reduces radiation
pressure. Consequently, the radiation pressure decreases again like N −1 . This is the
Mie regime of scattering. The maximum is thus a pure diffraction effect, a so-called
Mie resonance. It corresponds to the nrf r , where the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans scattering
approximation looses its validity according to (20.131). In Excs. 20.2.5.3 and 20.2.5.4
we study Mie and Rayleigh-Debye-Gans scattering, and in 20.2.5.5 we discuss the
question is whether recoil is imparted to individual atoms or to the center-of-mass of
the whole cloud.
In the limit of the approximations made, our formula correctly describes the radiation pressure force on extended objects. These objects can either be ensembles of
scatterers like homogeneous, ordered or disordered atomic clouds of arbitrary shapes
and volumes, or macroscopic objects like dielectric spheres. The formula thus represents a bridge between microscopic Rayleigh scattering and macroscopic Mie scattering. At very low atom numbers, the atomic cloud basically represents a randomly
distributed bunch of scatterers, whose intrinsic disorder spoils cooperativity. The
radiation pressure is then well described by the single-atom value. At large atom
numbers, the atomic cloud forms a smooth density distribution characterized by an
almost perfect a cooperativity, which is only limited by Mie scattering.

Spherical harmonics expansion and generalized timed
Dicke state

The results derived in (20.120) assumed the cloud to be in a timed Dicke state. As

14 Note the necessity of another condition [n

shifts induced by the cloud’s refraction index. The timed Dicke states might work
well for homogeneous cylinders, but not for ellipsoidal clouds, which we assume in our
analytical treatments. Therefore, a better approach consists in expanding the cloud
into spherical harmonics. Under the assumption that the cloud is radially symmetric,
ρ(r) = ρ(r), we get [217],

with the following parameters: σ = 2, ∆0 = 10Γ, Ω0 = 0.001Γ, and η = 1. The magenta
dots show a fully numerical calculation for a randomly generated cloud according to formula
(20.63). The red lines show a calculation according to the complete formula (20.139). The
cyan dots show a calculation assuming timed Dicke states according to (20.82) via numerical
calculation of the structure factor according to (20.83) for the same randomly generated

As seen in Fig. 20.15, the results obtained via the complete analytical formula

But both disagree with analytical and numerical results obtained within the timed
Dicke state approximation.

Mie resonances

It is an interesting question whether the maxima found in the curves of Fig. 20.15 can
be associated with Mie resonances [76, 584, 54]. To show this we need to apply the
formalism of Mie scattering to atomic clouds with the smooth density approximation,
where it is described by a continuous refraction index, as studied in Ref. [27]. The Mie
formalism had been developed for homogeneous spheres, which can be dielectric or
absorptive. For more general refractive index distribution the formalism gets quickly
cumbersome 15 . Also Mie resonances are generally though of being conditioned to
the existence of sharp boundaries.
The results of Ref. [27] surprisingly show that Mie resonances are expected for
parabolic distributions of atoms, as is the case for example for Bose-Einstein condensates in the Thomas-Fermi limit. However, the spectra of Mie resonances exhibit
much less structure. This is understood by the fact that ’whispering galery’ Mie resonances may live on the surface of a sphere whose refraction index drops quadratically
to zero, while cavity type Mie resonances may not.

20.3.0.2

Coherent backscattering

Shining coherent light on a homogeneous cloud, we expect no coherent scattering
(exception made of multiple-atom scattering in backward direction, CBS and of fluctuations like speckle patterns). Like radiation trapping, coherent backscattering (CBS)
is a manifestation of interference in multiple scattering. Just like photon echoes it
is not due to interatomic correlations. While in radiation trapping this leads to an
energy storage inside the atomic cloud connected to destructive interference of the radiation emitted to the cloud’s outside, when the coherent beam is reflected at a diffuse
scattered, one observes speckle patterns. This holds as well for laser light reflection as
for atomic wave reflections at a rough surface. See also (watch talk).
The coherent backscattering is an effect of constructive interference between two
light scattering paths having the exact time-reversed single scattering sequence,

Only the second term makes speckles. However, the atomic motion smoothes out
the speckle pattern in all directions. Only in the presence of correlations in the
atomic positions they do not. E.g. in crystals or in the backscattering directions.
Therefore, the constructive interference depends strongly on the backscattering angle
ϑ. Fast atomic motion internal excitations can dynamically break the time-reversal
symmetry of the scattering path, esp. when the laser is close to resonance and the
phase delay per scattering process is long. Coherent backscattering is a weak form of
Anderson localization (also strong localization) of light.

Scattering from periodic structures and photonic bands

Long-range spatial ordering can have a dramatic influence on the propagation of light
and the cooperativity of scattering, as we have already pointed out in the introduction
of the structure factor in Sec. 20.1.1. This is true for the scattering of electronic waves
in crystals. But atomic gases can also be arranged in periodic luminous potentials

674

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING

generated by dipolar forces (introduced in Sec. 19.2.2) exerted by counterpropagating
laser beams. Such potentials, called optical lattices, can be realized with various
geometries in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions. See also (watch talk).
Periodic structures are usually probed by Bragg scattering. This procedure can
be applied to atoms ordered in optical lattices [64, 642, 579, 581]: A test beam with
wavevector kbrg and intensity Ibrg is irradiated into the atomic cloud, and the power
Ps of the first-order reflected beam by Bragg is detected under a solid angle Ωs . Bragg
diffraction is an interference effect of radiation patterns emitted by Rayleigh scattering
from periodically aligned point-like antennas, the interference being constructive in
only specified directions.
For optically dilute lattices, where multiple reflections can be neglected, the imaginary part of the atomic response is sufficient to describe Bragg reflection. For optically dense lattices, multiple reflections between consecutive atomic layers lead to
interference phenomena between reflected and transmitted light fields and cause the
emergence of frequency bands, inside which the propagation of light waves through
the cloud is prohibited. These bands are known as forbidden photonic bands.
Photonic bands in optical lattices are interesting for several reasons:
1. They may facilitate the study of the phenomenon of Anderson localization. In
fact, Anderson location of light in atomic gases requires very high densities or
very large optical cross sections. Now, it is expected that, if the disorder is
realized within periodic structures near the Bragg condition, the high density
requirement is dramatically relaxed.
2. They modify the local density of states in a way to suppress spontaneous emission.
3. In optical lattices, unlike other systems, the scattering is very weak except when
the light is tuned close to atomic resonances. Consequently, the expected forbidden bands are very narrow. This bears the advantage that we can adjust
the optical density and tune the photon energy and the Bragg angle (i.e. the
quasi-momentum) independently, which facilitates the mapping of the dispersion relation.
4. Crystals are always hampered by defects in the periodicity [358]. In latestgeneration photonic crystals, the typical distance over which coherent light turns
diffuse is limited to less than 20 µm. This limitation plays no role in optical
lattices, where the delocalized photons rigorously guarantee perfect long-range
order, even though the Debye-Waller factor may introduce local disorder.
Spectra of photonic bands in atomic clouds were detected experimentally [553]
in one-dimensional structures. Most of the above mentioned effects require omnidirectional photonic bands, but this is technically very difficult, mainly because of the
narrow linewidth of the atomic transitions. We will develop this point in the course
of this section. We also mention the prediction of forbidden photon bands in Bose
condensates [406].
A presentation on this subject is available here (watch talk).

Example 87 (Optical lattice): The exponential distribution e−6∆kx r̄ is called
Debye-Waller factor and describes the smearing out of the population over the
lattice due to the thermal motion of the atoms. The δ-function sets the wavevector of emitted light. That is, the power of light is only emitted in particular
directions given by the Bragg condition. Here, the solid angle ∆Ωs does not
depend on the thermal distribution (as long as the atoms are within the LambDicke regime), but on the lattice size, which determines the goodness of the
approximation of the Airy function (the sum in the above equation) by a Dirac
δ-function. The
√ width of the Airy function for a lattice of size w0 is approximately ∆k = 2 3/w0 . With this the solid angle is,

It depends quadratically on the number of atoms. Strictly speaking, the derivation only applies to perfectly ordered lattices, i.e. all the lattice sites are equally
occupied. Defects lead to diffuse scattering, i.e. a background of isotropically
distributed power at the expense of Bragg scattering. The sharpness of the
Bragg radiation distribution remains intact.

In Exc. 20.4.4.2 we derive the structure factor in spherical coordinates.
Some comments are needed:
1. The structure factor treatment assumes low optical density, which is not necessarily guaranteed when the laser is tuned close to a resonance [579].
2. As the structure factor is independent of the laser detuning, it will not reveal
any spectral structure, such as a band-gap or dip due to diffuse scattering. Also,
absorption is not incorporated into the model.
20.4.1.2

The structure factor and the Bragg condition

The reciprocal space, obtained by Fourier transformation of the periodic density distribution, also adopts the shape of a periodic lattice. The Bragg condition requires
that the difference between the incident and emitted wavevectors, ∆k ≡ ks − ki ,
matches a vector of the reciprocal lattice, rj = jG. The Bragg condition is thus
automatically incorporated into the structure factor (20.200).

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING

This is illustrated in Fig. 20.16(a). If the transverse distribution can be considered
as homogeneous, as shown in Fig. 20.16(b), we have as second condition,
βi = −βs .

(20.166)

That is, the angles of incidence and reflection must be the same, as if we were dealing
with a dielectric mirror. In contrast, if the transverse extent of the atomic layers gets
smaller (until converging to the limit of a one-dimensional chain of point-scatterers,
G ≡ 2kdip êz ), we return to the condition (20.165). In intermediate situations, illustrated in Fig. 20.16(c), and for λdip cos βi 6= λ the reflection angle does not follow any
of the relations (20.165) and (20.166).

Transfer matrices calculation 1D-lattices

For one-dimensional optical lattices, that is, when the atoms are trapped in a potential dipole generated by a stationary light wave, we may consider applying the
transfer matrix formalism developed in Secs. 3.3. The premisses of this model are
the homogeneity and the infinite extent of the cloud in a direction transverse to the
optical axis.
We calculate the reflection coefficient β of a classical polarizable sample from the
microscopic polarizability and the optical density (depth) of a thin layer, nδzσ0 ,

model, we calculate how the incident and reflected light fields transform from one layer
to another. The intrinsically 1D model allows to calculate the reflection, transmission,
and absorption by the atomic lattice as a function of the incident laser frequency.

Limit of optically dense clouds

The intensity reflection profile, therefore, is a Lorentzian also in the limit of thick

the Kronig-Penney model introduced in Sec. 5.3.

682
20.4.2.3

CHAPTER 20. COOPERATIVITY IN LIGHT SCATTERING
Application of transfer matrices to real 1D optical lattices

The analytical treatment shown in the previous sections does not take account of
possible lattice imperfections, since the atomic layers are assumed to be identical,
infinitely thin, immobile and located at fixed periodic distances. Realistic optical
lattices are different for several reasons:
1. Atomic clouds are not perfectly localized in ultra-thin layers, but distributed
in a Gaussian way as a function of the cloud’s temperature. The Debye-Waller
factor (20.158) describes the impact of this distribution on the Bragg model.
2. The atoms are in thermal motion causing an inhomogeneous Doppler shift and
are affected by the photonic recoil received in each scattering process. This
causes a broadening of the reflection profiles and decreases the interference capability.
3. The number of atoms per layer may vary. Also, the global extent of the cloud is
not infinite, that is, we have Ns layers filled with atoms with a gradual decrease
at the confines of the cloud.
4. The atoms trapped in the optical potential are subjected to a dynamic Stark
shift 18 causing an inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic transition as well.
5. The periodicity of the lattice is slightly modified because the refractive index
experienced by the laser beams creating the dipole potential locally depends on
the atomic density concentrated in the lattice’s anti-nodes. The consequence is
a local decrease of the lattice constant d 19 .
All of the aforementioned imperfections may be included in a numerical treatment
of the transfer matrices. For this we subdivide the atomic cloud into sufficiently thin
sublayers, as shown in Fig. 20.17. Each sublayer, being characterized by its own 2D
atomic density and its own shift from resonance, is described by an individual transfer
matrix. The matrices are concatenated, and the reflection profile is computed, as
shown in the expression (20.180) [580]. Fig. 20.18 shows a numerical calculation
of a photonic band in a rubidium optical lattice. The experimental variables are
the incidence angle θ of the probe laser and its tuning ∆ from a transition λsp . ∆
determines σ and β via the polarizability (20.170) 20 and thus governs the propagation
of light inside the layers. θ determines kz d and thus probes the periodicity between
the layers.
Depending on the atomic density we can identify different behaviors 21 :

correctly: If between λdip and λD1 a photonic band were created for the laser beams that
produce the optical lattice [173, 641], these beams would be reflected without being able to penetrate
the lattice. In fact, the periodicity changes in such a way, that the frequency of the beams is at the
edge of the band gap. Deutsch et al. [173] showed that a self-consistent solution gives the modified
lattice constant,

1. At the limit of thin lattices, we do not expect multiple scattering. The absorptive
(imaginary) part of polarizability dominates, β ≈ Im β. Thus, the reflection
coefficient is almost real, reıφ ≈ |r|, the phase shifts are negligible, the profile
of the reflection spectrum is symmetric. In this scheme, the interference of the
radiation patterns of individual atoms is destructive in all directions, except
under the Bragg angle. There are losses caused by scattering in non-paraxial
modes. They are also due to elastic Rayleigh scattering but, because of the
finite Debye-Waller factor, the radiation becomes diffuse and incoherent.
2. At the limit of thick lattices, we have multiple scattering. The (real) dispersive
part of the polarizability is β ≈ Re β. Thus, absorption is suppressed, we
observe large phase shifts and the reflection spectrum profile is asymmetric.
Multiple beam interference gives rise to global scattering.
Physically, the set parameters consistent of the quasi-momentum and the energy
of the Bloch wave, (Θ, ∆), is more relevant because it allows analyzing the dispersion
relation 22 . We observe the existence of energies ∆, where the real part of the quasimomentum vanishes (modulo π). The 3D representation in Fig. 20.18(e) illustrates
the occurrence of an avoided crossing due to the band gap at the edge of the Brillouin
zone.

In fact, Bragg resonances can be understood in reciprocal space as reflections at
the edges of the Brillouin zone. Through the angle of incidence of the injected light
beam, we adjust the quasi-momentum. The frequency of the light beam determines
the energy. The forbidden photonic bands are caused by the formation of an energetic
gap in the dispersion relation induced by the interaction of the atoms with the optical
lattice.

Intensity distribution and LDOS within a lattice

z = a inside the lattice[580].
To calculate this intensity we assume that the network is located between the
points z = 0 and z = b of the optical axis with 0 < a < b. The transfer through the

20.4.2.5

Suppression of spontaneous emission in forbidden photonic bands

The decrease in the LDOS is equivalent to the suppression of spontaneous emission 23 ,
that is, an excited atom located inside the lattice will not be able to emit its photon.
This is the condition for a forbidden photonic band to be omnidimensional. Omnidirectional bands need three-dimensional lattices. Nevertheless, the reduction of
the spontaneous emission rate has already been observed in [282, 659], which can be
interpreted as 1D photonic crystals.
20.4.2.6

Impurities

The formula (20.197) allows the calculation of the impact of localized defects in numerical simulations. For example, it is instructive to look at the intensity profile along
the structure in the presence of a localized lattice defect. In Fig. 20.20(c) we observe
an intensity peak located at the 100-th atomic layer, exactly where the defect was
introduced. This peak corresponds to a localized evanescent wave. Photons can not
propagate freely through the lattice: they prefer to tunnel between lattice defects the
rather than propagate by radiation.
The curves (a-b) of Fig. 20.20 illustrate how an empty photonic band fills up with
localized states with well-defined energies when noise is added to the periodicity of
the lattice. This situation is similar to that in semi-conductors doped by donor and
acceptor states.

20.4.3

Photonic bands in the Bloch and the coupled dipoles
models

The transfer matrix model is limited in several respects:
1. Firstly, being intrinsically 1D, the model does not apply to 2D or 3D lattices.
2. Also, it does not incorporate the possibility of transverse disorder or effects
linked to the finite transverse extension of the atomic layers, for example, the

limitation of the number of layers participating in multiple reflection (’walk-off’)
[581] or the impact of an imperfect mode matching [579].
In contrast, the coupled dipoles model offers several advantages. An optical lattice is, after all, nothing more than a periodically ordered diluted sample of atoms.
Hence, we can apply the coupled dipoles model introduced in Sec. 20.1.2 [541, 540].
The advantages of this model are its applicability to 3D systems and finite and disordered lattices. It also allows the inclusion of all kinds of inhomogeneities such as, for
example, the spatial intensity distribution of a focused incident laser, or the deviation
of the laser beam penetrating an atomic cloud due to refraction. On the other hand,
the model only lends itself to heavy numerical simulations, limiting it to some 10000
atoms.
20.4.3.1

The Bloch model and forbidden electronic bands

The Bloch model is another model to describe 3D periodic systems [17]. It was introduced in Chp. 5.4 for 1D optical lattices. Its disadvantages are that it supposes
infinite lattices and the absence of defects.
The Bloch model is commonly used to describe the scattering of electron waves in
a solid, where the band gap originates from the Coulomb interaction of the electron
with the atoms of the solid crystal. In contrast, in photonic crystals, the modes with
high (low) frequency ω concentrate their energy in spatial regions with low (high)
dielectric index . Close to geometric (Mie) resonances this causes a repulsion in
the density distribution of photonic states, and the opening of a gap separating high
frequency bands (air bands) from low frequency bands.
In optical lattices the photons interact with the atomic resonances. Photons and
electrons are distinguished by their different dispersion relations and by the fact that
electronic waves are scalar and photonic waves are vectorial. The electrons of a crystal
are bound to an energy surface and follow the lines of the dispersion relation without
leaving the metal. In contrast, photons are usually injected into the structure, which
gives an additional degree of freedom. Therefore, any point in the phase diagram
can be reached and the dispersion relation only informs, where at which point the
transmission is stronger.

Coupling of atoms and optical
cavities and the CQED
regime
So far we have considered the coherent dynamics between atoms and radiation fields
in free space, and we extended the theory to take into account the dissipative coupling
to the electromagnetic vacuum by spontaneous emission and atomic motion. The vacuum represents a homogeneous and isotropic reservoir characterized by a continuous
white energy spectrum. The situation changes completely when we place the atom
inside an optical cavity which breaks the translational and rotational symmetries and
imprints a resonance structure into the density of photonic states. Obviously, the
cavity will profoundly change the atomic coupling to the electromagnetic vacuum,
and hence the way in which the atom reacts to incident light, as much with respect
to light scattering as with respect to optical forces.
In this chapter we will focus on the dynamics of the optical field modes of a
cavity pumped by incident laser beams. In Sec. 21.1 we study the behavior of empty
cavities, and in Sec. 21.3 we turn our attention to the impact of atoms (or macroscopic
scatterers) on the cavity dynamics. The impact of optical cavities on the internal and
the motional dynamics of the atoms is the subject of the Chp. 22.6.1.

CHAPTER 21. COUPLING OF ATOMS AND OPTICAL CAVITIES

21.1

Light fields in cavities without atoms

We will consider the degree of freedom to be studied in this chapter, which is the
electric field amplitude of a light field developing in a mode of an optical cavity, as a
classical entity. The quantization of the electromagnetic field will be discussed in the
context of cavity QED in Sec. 22.5. Therefore, there is no need to stress quantum
mechanics to derive the fundamental equations of motion, and a classical derivation
is shown in Sec. 21.3.5. Nevertheless, for reasons of consistency with later discussions,
where quantization is required, we will reproduce here the standard procedure, which
consists in constructing the Hamiltonian for the relevant degrees of freedom. The
degree of freedom under study being a mode of a cavity, we will label it by the field
operator â normalized to the electric field strength E~1 generated by a single photon,
such that |hâi|2 = n represents the number of photons in the cavity.
In this first section of this chapter we will only consider a bare cavity not containing
any matter which could interact with light. The mode of a linear cavity or the two
counterpropagating modes of a ring cavity are pumped by incident laser light. We
will first set up the equations of motion for the cavity fields and then discuss the main
quantities characterizing a cavity, such as free spectral range, mode volume, decay
rate, and single-photon field strength. Finally, we will calculate the density of states
of cavities.

= ıηâ† + h.c.

with [âω , â†ω0 ] = δω,ω0 . The part of the Hamiltonian Ĥlaser:cavity describes pumping
of the cavity with an external light field matched to the cavity mode. The standard
procedure consists in setting up the quantum Liouville equation for the total density
operator ρ̂total = ρ̂cavity ⊗ ρ̂bath , assuming a quantum Wiener process, and tracing
the over the bath’s degrees of freedom [230, 129]. From this procedure, as shown in
Sec. 16.2.4, we derive a master equation for the reduced density operator ρ̂.
The inevitable coupling of the cavity to the environment, described by Ĥcavity:bath ,
leads to irreversible losses. These losses can be described as spontaneous decay to the
continuous vacuum heat bath. The irreversibility of the process is readily understood
in terms of the phase space offered by the vacuum being much larger. In fact, whenever
discrete states are coupled to a continuum, the equilibrium is very much on the side of
the continuum, that is, discrete states decay. Since an optical cavity can be considered

We have already shown this in Exc. 16.2.5.1. The constants are the cavity decay rate
κ and the pump rate β. Note that at room temperature in the microwave regime,
n̄ may be as large as a few hundred photons, whereas in the optical regime we may
neglect the thermal excitation,

The result (21.7) shows that, letting η = 0, we see that the cavity field decays with
the time constant κ from the stationary situation. κ also corresponds to the HWHM
2
of the field intensity, |α(|∆c | = κ)| = 12 |α(0)|2 . Note, that the intensity decays as
√
2κ, and the HWHM of the field amplitude is α(|∆c | = 3κ) = 21 |α(0)|.
Example 88 (Evolution of the modes of a linear cavity ): (21.7) also shows
that a cavity initially filled with a strong resonant light field |α(0)|  η/κ begins
to oscillate at its own frequency ωc , before the pump dominates and imposes its
own frequency ω. This is illustrated in Fig. 21.2. .

Also we may want to consider a temporal variation of the input field, for example of

We will study in Exc. 21.1.5.1 how a sudden change of the pump laser detuning may
lead to ringing with a fixed frequency ∆c . In Exc. 21.1.5.2 we will show, how it is
possible to empty an optical cavity in times shorter than 1/κ.

21.1.2

Dynamics of an empty ring cavity

In case of an ring cavity, we have two counterpropagating modes α± , which may be
independently pumped by laser beams η±. Hence, the quantum Langevin equation
(21.5) must be generalized to,
α̇± (t) = (−κ − ı∆c )α± + η± ,

(21.10)

The two counterpropagating field modes will, provided they have the same polarization, interfere and form a standing light wave. In contrast to linear cavities, the
phase of this standing wave is represents a degree of freedom, as it depends on the
phases of the two field modes α± , which in turn can be controlled by the incident

Characterization of the bare cavity

We first consider a linear cavity of length L pumped by a laser without any scatterer
located inside the cavity. The cavity spectrum is an equidistant comb of eigenfrequencies separated by,

The free spectral range δf sr is given in units of a real frequency. τrt
is the time for
a photon to make a round trip in the cavity. The amplitude decay rate of the cavity,

21.1. LIGHT FIELDS IN CAVITIES WITHOUT ATOMS

The intensity decay rate of the cavity, measured by ’cavity ring-down’ is 2κ. Note,
that κ is also the FWHM width of the intensity transmission spectrum 1 .
Example 89 (Finesse of a cavity ): For example, for a cavity of length L =
10 cm an intensity decay time of τint = 20 µs is measured, and we want to
evaluate the finesse. We begin calculating the free spectral range δf sr = c/2L ≈
1.5 GHz. Since the cavity field decays like E(t) = E0 e−κt and the intensity like
I(t) = E02 e−2κt , we get κ = 1/τκ = 1/2τint ≈ (2π) 4 kHz. Finally, the finesse is
F = πδf sr /κ ≈ 189000.

CHAPTER 21. COUPLING OF ATOMS AND OPTICAL CAVITIES

We assume that the cavity is pumped by a laser beam. To estimate the pump rate,
we assume that the power Pinput be measured in transmission. The coefficient η for

21.1.4.1

The role of cavity geometry

For light in a cavity, the density of states is modified with respect to free space,
because it becomes frequency-dependent and anisotropic. The frequency dependence
is expressed by the Airy formula,

which will be derived in Excs. 21.1.5.3 and 21.1.5.4, and the anisotropy by,
R(êk ) = 1

∀

êk ∈ Ωcav ,

(21.40)

where Ωcav is the solid angle covered by the cavity mode. The formula,
ρcav (ω, k) = ρf ree (ω)[1 − R(êk )] + ρf ree (ω)L(ω)R(êk )

(21.41)

expresses that the density of states is nothing more than the structure factor of the
cavity.
21.1.4.2

Confocal cavities

For a confocal cavity the solid angle is easy to calculate [282, 283]. Denoting by b is

where ϕmn is the frequency shift of the transverse modes.
21.1.4.3

More correctly, êk ∈ Ωmn means that we must weigh the density of states by the

encountered high reflector. For each for intensity study the cases that (i) the ring
cavity is resonant and (ii) off-resonance. Also study the limit rhr → 1. Disregard
absorption losses.

21.2

Atoms in cooperative environments

In this section we will study ab initio atoms subject to cooperative environments
imposed by the presence of other atoms or the presence of cavities. We note that
the role of cavities can be understood as generating mirror images with which the
atom under consideration interacts. We restrict to non-interacting atoms, that is,
free atoms or atoms trapped in external potentials that only interact with each other
via re-scattering of an incident radiation field, i.e. no collisions and no properties
requiring symmetrization of their wavefunctions. Both the atomic excitation and the
radiation fields may decay.
In Sec. 21.2.1 we study a single atom or two atoms in a cooperative environment
(e.g. a cavity). In Sec. 21.2.2 we study scattering from correlated atoms, and finally,
in Sec.21.2.3, we have a propose an interpretation of super- and sub-radiance as a
modification of the structure factor by ’spontaneous stimulation’, i.e. by ’cooperativity’.

21.2.1

One and two atoms in a cooperative environment

The quantization of the electromagnetic field has been presented in Sec. 15.1.1 for
the case of plane wave radiation modes. In the following, we want to generalize the
treatment to arbitrary field modes characterized by mode functions ukλ (r) labeled by

a wavevector and a polarization. These are classical vector functions satisfying the
vector Helmholtz equation and the transversality condition,
[∇2 + kλ2 ]ukλ (r) = 0

and

∇ · ukλ (r) = 0 ,

(21.52)

with kλ = ωkλ /c [432]. These classical functions are chosen to form an orthonormal

The quantum properties of the electric and magnetic field operators are determined by
the bosonic annihilation and creation operators, âkλ (t) and â†kλ (t), respectively, with
usual commutation relations: [âkλ (t), âk0 λ0 (t)] = 0 and [âkλ (t), â†k0 λ0 (t)] = δkk0 δλλ0 .

21.2.1.1

Two atoms

Let us now consider two excited atoms labeled by q = 1, 2, located at r1 and r2 , and
described by two of their eigenstates, {|gq i, |eq i}. As usual, |gq i is the eigenstate with
lowest energy (Egq = − 21 ~ωq ) and longer lifetime, i.e. the ground state, whereas |eq i
is the eigenstate with highest energy (Eeq = + 12 ~ωq ) coupled to |gq i. In presence of
an external electromagnetic field, the Hamiltonian of the two atom-field system in the
electric dipole approximation is,
X (q)
(q)
Ĥ =
[Ĥatom + Ĥatom:f ield ] + Ĥf ield ,
(21.62)
q=1,2

(q)

where Ĥatom ≡ ~ωq Ŝqz is the atomic Hamiltonian, with Ŝqz ≡

2 (|eq iheq |

− |gq ihgq |)
ˆ
~ q ) is the
being the energy operator of the q-th atom, and
≡ −d̂q · E(r
atom-field interaction Hamiltonian. The electric dipole moment operator satisfies
heq |d̂q |eq i = 0 = hgq |d̂q |gq i and has non-vanishing off-diagonal elements, i.e. the
eigenstates have no permanent dipole moment. We define the dipole-moment matrix
element as dq ≡ heq |d̂q |gq i. The description of the field is identical to the case of one
atom (21.54).
For weak-coupling between the atoms and the field, the interaction Hamiltonian
becomes,

(21.66)
which shows explicitly the cooperative effect of the dipole-dipole interaction in the
spontaneous emission rate.

21.2.2

Scattering from correlated atoms

Until now we disregarded the possibility that the atoms in the ensemble be correlated.
In Sec. 15.1 we have shown how to describe the dynamics of a single two-level atom
driven by a quantized electromagnetic field and embedded in an electromagnetic vacuum under the assumption that the driving field be a plane wave and the vacuum
be isotropic. In the following, we want to relax these conditions. We proceed by
generalizing Eq. (15.7) by replacing the plane wave eık·r by a mode function uk (r)
and by allowing the coupling constant (15.17) gk to depend on k. Furthermore, we
will extend the formalism to the presence of several atoms.
21.2.2.1

Master equation for two atoms

We have already introduced master equations for two- and three-level systems in
Secs. 14.3.3 and 14.5.1. This concept cam be extended to two coupled two-level
systems [46],

Thus, we have 16 equations to describe the evolutions of the 16 components of the
total density matrix (%ij ).

21.2.3

The Dicke model of super- and subradiance

The Dicke model describes the coupling of single light mode with a set of N twolevel atoms [175, 293]. When the coupling between the light and matter crosses a
critical value, the Dicke model shows a mean-field phase transition to a superradiant
phase. The Hilbert space of the Dicke model is given by (the tensor product of) the
states of the cavity and of the two-level atoms. The Hilbert space of the cavity can
be spanned by Fock states |ni. The states of each two-level atom j = 0, 1, .., N are
ˆj = (σ̂ x , σ̂ y , σ̂ z ), satisfying the spin algebra
defined through the spin operators ~σ
j
j
j
[σ̂jx , σ̂ky ] = ı~σ̂jz δj,k .

The coupling can be written as the sum of two terms: a co-rotating term that conserves
the number of excitations and is proportional to âσ̂ + + â† σ̂ − and a counter-rotating
term proportional to âσ̂ − + â† σ̂ + .
The above Hamiltonian assumes that all the spins are identical (i.e. have the same
energy difference and are equally coupled to the cavity). Under this assumption, one
can define the macroscopic spin operators,
Ŝ α ≡

N
X

σ̂jα

with

[Ŝ x , Ŝ y ] = ı~Ŝ z ,

(21.73)

and α = x, y, z. Using these operators, one can rewrite the above Hamiltonian as
Ĥ = ωc â† â + ωa Ŝ z + 2g(â + â† )Ŝ x .

spin-S with Ŝ ≤ N/2, whose Hilbert space has size 2S + 1, rather than N spin-1/2,
whose Hilbert space has size 2N .
The Dicke model has one global symmetry,
P : (â, σ̂ ± ) → (−â, −σ̂ ± ) .

(21.75)

Because P squares to unity, it has two eigenvalues, 1 and −1. This symmetry is
associated with a conserved quantity: the parity of the total number of excitations,
P = (−1)Nex , where
N
X
Nex = â† a +
σ̂jz .
(21.76)
j=1

This parity conservation can be seen from the fact that each term in the Hamiltonian
preserves the excitation number, except for the counter-rotating terms, which can
only change the excitation number by ±2. A state of the Dicke model is said to be
normal when this symmetry is preserved, and superradiant when this symmetry is
spontaneously broken.
The Dicke model is closely related to other models of quantum optics (see table
below). The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry gives rise to a lasing state.

Dicke states

The Dicke states can be organized as follows. We consider an ensemble of N = N↓ +N↑
two-level atoms excited by a definite number of M photons, such that N↑ − N↓ = 2M .
The N atoms can occupy 2N different collective states. However, when the atoms
are identical and couple uniformly to the same light mode, all states where the same
number of atoms is excited are energetically degenerate, and the total energy available
to the system is,
E = M ~ωc ,
(21.77)
whereas the level of degeneracy is,
N!
N!

This shows the existence of a singlet state, which decouples from the triplet states, in
particular the deexcited one. Hence, this state is stable or subradiant 3 . For example

21.3

Interaction of atoms with cavities

In this section we will introduce some parameters characterizing the interaction between atoms and cavities. In particular, we will relate the important notions of the
cooperativity of several atoms and the structure factor for light scattering, with the
cavity-to-free space scattering ratio, the finesse and the density-of-states of a cavity,
simply by pointing out that a cavity multiplies the number of atoms interacting with
a light modes by the number of its mirror images.

21.3.1

Spontaneous emission in cavities and cooperativity

The cooperativity parameter of a cavity is defined as the rate at which an atom emits
into the volume of a cavity mode normalized to the rate at which it would scatter
into free space,

CHAPTER 21. COUPLING OF ATOMS AND OPTICAL CAVITIES
Modification of the natural linewidth by cavities

In a cavity, spontaneous emission is strongly modified [282, 283, 284]. An atom
interacting with a cavity will spontaneously emit into the cavity mode at an increased
(reduced) rate, depending on whether the cavity is resonant or out of resonance. The
natural width due to spontaneous decay and the line shift are calculated by integration
over the coupling force between the atom and every available field mode [see (21.60)],

with the field amplitude per photon, |E~k | = ~ωk /2ε0 V , derived in (21.31), and the
index i running over all internal atomic states. These formulas are simply applications
of second-order perturbation theory (6.16) and of Fermi’s golden rule (6.115) for
transition probabilities both weighed with dynamic structure factor of the cavity.
We use the number of modes per unit of frequency range and per unit of solid
angle in free space derived in (21.38) (ρ/V is the density of states),

is not in place, yet, as we are still in free space), d · ˆk = d cos αk = d cos(90◦ − θk ) =

Since the integration covers the whole solid angle of space 4π and the free space is
isotropic, there is no preferred orientation, and we can perform the integration setting
θ ≡ θk . The result coincides with earlier calculations (13.43).

Figure 21.3: Illustration of cooperativity in a cavity. An excited atom can decay by emitting
light into a cavity mode or into free space. Note that the cavity is not pumped directly by
an incident laser beam.

Now, we put the cavity in place, but tune it off resonance, such that no photons
can be emitted into the solid angle covered by the cavity. That is, in the presence of

21.3. INTERACTION OF ATOMS WITH CAVITIES

the cavity, the solid angle of free space into which photons can be emitted is restricted.
We repeat the calculation (21.85), but now we are not free to choose the axis of the
coordinate system arbitrarily. Instead, we we assume that θk (θ, φ) ' const over the
small solid angle covered by the cavity, θ, φ ∈ Ωcav ,

Finally, we study the situation, when the cavity is in place but now tuned on

modulated by the Airy function (21.39),
ρcav (ωk , k) = ρf ree (ωk )L(ωk ) .

(21.87)

That is, photons can be emitted into the cavity mode with increased probability.

The quantities Γcav and Γf ree∈cav are scattering rates into complementary solid

The scattering will fill the cavity with photons, until the leakage equalizes the
pumping. When the balance is reached, Γcav will also be the rate at which photons
are emitted by the cavity mode. We calculate an example in Exc. 21.3.8.2.

Obviously, the atom-field coupling strength g plays a central role in the modification
of the emission spectra of atoms interaction with cavities. Therefore, we will have to
study this quantity more deeply in the next sections.
Example 91 (Cooperativity of non-degenerate and confocal cavities): For
example, for a non-degenerate linear cavity with finesse F = 110000 and waist
w0 = 50 µm at 689 nm, the cooperativity is relatively weak, Υ ' 1. Still, at this
cooperativity, half of the spontaneously emitted photons go into a tiny solid
angle represented by the cavity. Confocal or concentric cavities may present
more favorable geometries [282, 283, 284]. With N0 = 104 saturated strontium
atoms, the light power scattered into the cavity is Pj = 20 fW. Estimation

21.3.2

Characterization of the atom-field coupling

In Sec. 21.1.3 we started introducing a number of quantities characterizing empty
cavities. We will now pursue this task including their interaction with atoms. In
particular, we will introduce three important quantities allowing us to measure the
degree of quantization of the system: the cooperativity Υ, the saturation parameter
s, and the cavity resolution r.

The atomic dipole moment

As usual, the interaction strength of an atom with a light field is measured by the
atom-field coupling constant, which is precisely HALF the single photon Rabi frequency. Using relationships derived in Sec. 21.1.3 and the expression (13.38) for the

In a cavity the flux δf sr = P/nph ~ω is just the photon round trip rate (or free
spectral range). 1/δf sr is the time a photon interacts with an atom. In free space,
this does not make sense to me, because I don’t know how define the mode volume. I
can however consider the interaction of a photon with an extended sample of length
L. In this case, a photon interacts with the sample for the time L/c, so that,

Collective cooperativity

While the strong coupling regime of the CQED requires Υ > 1 with a single atom,
collective cooperativity is reached with N atoms if N Υ > 1 [91, 130]. In this case, the
atomic ensemble couples to the
√ mode like a single ’super-atom’, the coupling force
being magnified to gN = g1 N . We have already obtained this result within the
Jaynes-Cummings model for two indistinguishable atoms coupling to the same light
mode and forming a Dicke state (see Sec. 17.2.4).
21.3.2.5

Saturation parameter in cavities

The saturation parameter for a single photon is given by,
s=

δf sr 6

(21.121)

We see, that there is a symmetry between Υ and s, that is, between Ncrt and nsat .
The regime N Υ > 1 denotes the collective behavior of N atoms in the same way as
nsat > 1 indicates saturation. While Υ depends only on the phase matching between
the atomic antenna and the cavity, s also depends on the cavity mode volume and
the natural decay rate.
21.3.2.6

Cavity resolution parameter

Comparing the photonic recoil, which is given by,
~k 2

(21.122)

with the resolution power of a cavity κ, we can define the resolution parameter,
ωrec =

r≡

ωrec

κ

(21.123)

With the three parameters defined in Eqs. (21.108), (21.120), and (21.123) we are
able to measure the degree of quantization of the degrees of freedom involved in the
matter-light interaction in a cavity. The cooperativity Υ measures the resolvability
of single atoms in the atomic cloud, which depends on the phase matching between
the atomic antenna (i.e. its optical cross section) and the focus of the optical mode.
The saturation parameter s measures the resolvability of single photons in the cavity.
And the cavity resolution parameter r measures the resolvability of the Doppler-shift
due to the atomic center-of-mass motion caused by the absorption of a single photon.
If one wants to operate in an environment, where all degrees of freedom involved in
the atom-light interactions are fully quantized, the atoms need to be placed into a
cavity whose characteristic quantities are all large, Υ, s, r  1.
In Exc. 21.3.8.3 we compare the coupling force and other characteristic parameters
for various combinations of atomic species and optical cavities. In Exc. 21.3.8.4 we
calculate the number of photons in a cavity pumped in or out of resonance.

21.3.3

Jaynes-Cummings model for 1 atom and 2 radiation
modes

The Hamiltonian for a single motionless atom interacting with two cavity modes |+i
and |−i (we may, for instance, consider the counterpropagating modes of a ring cavity)
reads,
Ĥatom
Ĥcav

= −∆a σ̂ + σ̂ −
= −∆+ â†+ â+ − ∆− â†− â−

Ĥatom:cav

= g(z)â†+ σ̂ − + h.c. + g(z)â†− σ̂ − + h.c.

Ĥlaser:cav

= −ıη+ (â+ − â†+ ) − ıη− (â− − â†− )

.

(21.124)

The coupling of the atom to the cavities g(z) will, in general, depend on the atomic
position. For simplicity let us, however, consider uniform and identical coupling,
g+ (z) = g− (z) = g, and furthermore assume that both cavities be on resonance,
∆+ = ∆− = 0. Finally, neglecting spontaneous emission and pumping, the total
number of photons is conserved. With ∆a = ω − ωa we get,
Ĥ = ωâ†+ â+ + ωâ†− â− + ω0 (σ̂ + σ̂ − 21 ) + gâ†+ σ̂ − + gâ†− σ̂ − + h.c. .
Expanding the operators â± =

(21.126)

Alternatively, in analogy with
L Sec. 15.2.1, we may organize the Hilbert space in orthogonal subspaces, Ĥ =
n Ĥn , each one having N ≡ j + n+ + n− energy units
distributed over the atomic excitation state j = 0, 1 and the numbers of photons n±
in each mode. Hence, every subspace is of dimension 2N + 1. In this dressed states
picture, introducing the photon imbalance D ≡ n+ −n− = −N, ..., N , we may expand
the coupled state like,

|ψ(t)i =

∞
N
X
X

N =0 D=−N

c̃N,D |N, Di .

(21.127)

Obviously, the set of three quantum numbers {j, n+ , n− } is equivalent to the set of
two quantum numbers {N, D} and can be recovered by,
j = 1 + (−1)N +D−1

,

n± = 21 (N ± D − j) .

(21.128)

are ground states. We may now write down the Hamiltonian,

One-axis twisting in the XX-Heisenberg model
p
The coupling strength N+ N− ≤ N2 between the cavity mode and the atoms depends
on the inversion. Hence, this leads to an inversion-dependent frequency shift known
as one-axis twisting. It is analogous to photon number dependent phase shift. In
the mean field treatment we simply replace the operators by their expectation values.

Tavis-Cummings model in a ring cavity

Cavity-mediated superradiance is described within the Tavis-Cummings model [105].
It represents an extension of the Jaynes-Cummings model for several atoms. We
discussed such systems in Sec. 17.2.

21.3.5

Ring cavity dynamics in the presence of an atom

The equations of motion (21.10) describe the evolution of the light fields in counterpropagating modes of a ring cavity. Without scatterer located in the mode volume,
the modes evolve independently. In contrast, a scatterer (e.g. an atom or a beamsplitter) may redistribute photons between the modes, whose dynamics thereby becomes
coupled.
We will in the following assume the scatterer as immobile, except for Sec. 21.4.1,
where we consider a vibrating scatterer. Immobile scatterers can, for example, be

(scratches, dust particles, etc.), which can scatter light both, out of the cavity and
into the reverse cavity mode. In laser gyroscopes this backscattering may induce a
locking of counterpropagating modes and hamper their proper operation.
21.3.5.1

Classical derivation of coupled atom-cavity equations

The equations of motion (21.10) describe the light fields classically. Hence, it is not
surprising that they can be derived with entirely classical arguments. Here, we will
show this for a ring cavity in the presence of an atom sitting at a fixed position
z on the cavity’s optical axis. We understand the atom as a beamsplitter located
within the mode volume of the resonator and partially reflecting and transmitting
incident light with reflection and transmission coefficients (rβ , tβ ) = (ıβ, 1 + ıβ) such
that rβ2 + t2β = 1. Transmitted (forward scattered) photons may be phase-shifted,
while reflected photons are backscattered into the counterpropagating mode of the
resonator.
Similarly, we treat the incoupling mirror as a beamsplitter with coefficients (rin , tin ).
The incident field Ein produces, in the cavity, field amplitudes of α± for the co- and
counterpropagating waves. As in (21.7), we normalize the amplitudes by the numbers
of photons n± ≡ |α± |2 . After a round-trip time τ = δf−1
sr through the mode volume
we have in the position of the incoupling mirror the field,

κ assuming that the light can only leave the cavity through this mirror. We define,
κ≡

as the part of the light lost during one round trip. Thus, tin =

It gives the cavity losses for the two modes during one round trip. We assume here that
losses can only occur via the coupling mirror. However, all losses can be included in a
single appropriate κ. There are usually other losses due to scattering on the surface of
the mirrors or absorption by the atoms. Finally, we obtain for weak atomic reflection

(21.161)

Example 92 (Classical CARL equations): If we were to treat the atomic
position z as a degree of freedom, we could calculate the classical potential of
the stationary light wave, and therefore the dipole force,
F = −∇φ = −~U0 ∇Z=z |α+ eıkZ + α− e−ıkZ |2 ,

and, consequently, derive the dynamics of the scatterer via,

(21.163)

This will be studied in Chp. 22.6.1. In the remaining sections of this chapter we
will assume the atom to be located at a fixed position.

In the above derivation we assumed, for simplicity, the pump laser on resonance
with the cavity, ∆c = 0. Relaxing this condition, an analogous derivation yields 4 ,
α̇± = (−κ + ı∆c − ıU0 )α± − ıU0 e∓2ıkz α∓ + η± .

21.3.6

(21.164)

Stationary solutions and spectra

Considering the atom fixed in space, ẋ = 0 = ṗ, we can concentrate on solving the
equations of motion (21.164) only for the fields. As a first approach, we look for
stationary solutions, being aware that they do not always exist, as we will see later in
the discussion of the proper CARL effect. In the Exc. 21.3.8.5 we derive the stationary
solutions of the equations:
α± =

[κ − ı(∆c − U0 )]η± − ıU0 e∓2ıkz η∓
.
[κ − ı(∆c − U0 )]2 + U02

(21.165)

mode. This approximation is only good far from resonance, ∆a  Γ. We will see in Sec. 22.1.3, how
to generalize the equations of motion for near resonance cases.

(21.168)

would be the Hamiltonian describing the coupling between counterpropagating modes.
The eigenvalues of this matrix are,
W (1,2) = 2U0 − ∆c − ıκ ,

− ∆c − ıκ .

(21.170)

This normal mode splitting 5 of the cavity results from the coupling of the two
cavity modes â†+ â− . Obviously, the energies and widths of the eigenvalues do not
depend neither on the pump intensities η± nor the z-position of the atom. On the
other hand, the spectral behavior of α± , and hence the observable quantities, such as
the transmission
2
κα±
T± ≡

depend on these parameters. In the Exc. 21.3.8.7 we will calculate the spectrum by
the condition 0 = ∂∆c α± (∞).
In the following, we will discuss two relevant cases: unidirectional pumping and
symmetrical pumping.
21.3.6.2

Unidirectional pumping

For unilateral pumping, η− = 0, the equation (21.167) simplifies to,

5 The splitting is not exactly the vacuum Rabi splitting, which occurs when the excitation can not
be eliminated adiabatically. The vacuum Rabi splitting results from the Jaynes-Cummings [614, 142]
and is caused by the coupling of internal and external states â† σ̂.

These formulas show that, for weak coupling, U0  κ, the counterpropagating mode
receives little light. On the other side, for strong coupling (or very high finesse) and

∆c = 0, the intensity is equally distributed, |α+ |2 = |α− |2 = η2κ

Or in other words, the phase of light determines the equilibrium position of the atom
(or vice versa). Two cases are interesting: (i) For ∆c = 0 and U0  κ the condition
(21.176) turns into tan θ = − tan 2kx. In this case, the phase of the backscattered
field adjusts in such a way, that the atom stays at the valleys of the anti-nodes.
(ii) For ∆c = U0 (or alternatively, when κ  U0 , ∆c ) the condition (21.176) turns
into tan θ = − tan(2kx+ π2 ), such that the atom is at half height of the potential slope,
exactly at the position, where it is able to backscatter the maximum of photons from
the pumped mode α+ to the mode α− .

To calculate the homogeneous time-dependent solution of the equation of motion of

We see that, in resonance and without pumping, the field adjusts its phase to the atom
and also decays with the rate κ, while the atom redistributes the photons between
modes with the (Rabi-)frequency 2U0 . The formula (21.184) does not show any
damping of the phase dynamics in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Thus, in the absence of
pumping, the cavity dissipation reduces only the field amplitudes, but does not damp
the adjustment of the phase to the atomic position.
21.3.6.5

Time-dependent solution with fixed pump

To find the complete solution of the inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation (21.168),
we first calculate the stationary solution,
α

(21.185)

This particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation, added to the general solution of the homogeneous equation, gives the general solution of the inhomogeneous
Schrödinger equation,

We derive and analyze this solution in the Exc. 21.3.8.11.

Forced atomic vibration in a ring cavity

We now assume, that the atom is forced to vibrate by an external force. The vibration
is described by,
kz = kz0 sin ωt .
(21.187)
2ωrec
We consider small modulation excursions, 1 & kz0 = kv
ω =

to saying that the oscillation frequency should exceed to recoil shift. In this (LambDicke) regime the Bessel-expansion yields,

The Fig. 21.11 shows how the phase of the ring cavity behaves in time for various
atom-field coupling constants.

Figure 21.11: (code) (a) Photon number and (b) phase shift of the cavity in response to
a modulated atomic position. The parameters are kz0 = 1, κ = (2π) 20 kHz, ω = 2.5κ,
and η± = 10κ. (c) Spectrum recorded behind a cavity mirror with the transmittivity thr .
The spectrum is obtained as the Fourier transform of the g (1) (τ ) correlation function of the
transmitted field Eout = thr eıka Ecav , where eıka is a fixed phase factor depending on the
mirror position a (see Sec. ??).

It is interesting to study the oscillatory response of the cavity-field to a forced
atomic vibration, because it yields information about the cavity backaction. In fact,
as shown above, the vibrating atom imprints sidebands to the intracavity refractive
index [543, 5]. The sidebands appear in the cavity transmission spectrum. A more
sophisticated method to detect the backaction could be to watch the response in the
beat signal to a periodic modulation of the incoupled fields with a vibrating atom,
α̇± = (−κ − ıU0 )α± − ıU0 e∓2ıkz0 sin ωt α∓ + ηe±ıφ0 sin ωφ t .

(21.199)

We would expect a clear signature for resonance, ωφ = ω. The sidebands of the
modulated pump would be coupled in, if they coincide. Instead of monitoring the
cavity field, we could search the signature of the backaction in the atomic response.
We will come back to this, when we discuss collective effects and the frequency shift
of the center-of-mass motion. Do Exc. 21.3.8.14.

Atomic motion in optical
cavities
In the preceding chapter we concentrated on the dynamics of the field modes of
laser-pumped cavities. We devoted a particular attention to the role of scatterers,
e.g. atoms, located in the mode volume and coupling the dynamics of counterpropagating modes. We assumed the atoms to be fixed in space, or at most subject to
an external force constraining their motion. We have also seen that the coupling of
counterpropagating modes critically depends on the position of the atom. Now, the
cavity fields are expected to exert light forces on the atoms eventually leading to their
displacement. As we will see in the following, this fact can have enormous impact on
the coupling dynamics and even induce macroscopic instabilities.
We devote Sec. 22.1 to the derivation of the complete equations of motion for the
case of a single atom, allowing for all degrees of freedom to be treated as quantized:
the atomic excitation, the motion of its center of mass, and the radiation field in
the cavity. We will provide a simple recipe for finding the suitable equations of
motion depending on which degree of freedom s to be treated as quantized and which
dissipation process to be taken into account. We will also show how and under which
circumstances the atomic excitation may be adiabatically eliminated.
In Sec. 22.2 we generalize the equations of motion of many atoms, but treating all
degrees of freedom as classical. This leads us to the paradigmatic Collective Atomic
Recoil Laser (CARL), a self-organization phenomenon whose relationship to other
such instabilities will be discussed in Sec. 22.3.
Finally, in Secs. 22.4 and 22.5 we will treat the light field, respectively, the atomic
motion quantum mechanically and show in which sense the obtained dynamics are
different.

22.1

Cavity interacting with a single atom

Here, we consider atoms interacting with the modes of an optical cavity pumped by
lasers. As we saw in the previous chapter, the density of the modes in a cavity is
concentrated around the optical axis, such that a scatterer located within the mode
emits preferentially within the cavity, where the light is recycled. Therefore, we can
in many situations treat the system as one-dimensional.
In free space, as discussed in Chp. 19.4, the force of light has two components:
the radiation pressure, which scatters photons isotropically into space, and the dipole
737

force, which can be interpreted in terms of a redistribution of photons between light
modes. In cavities, where the isotropic scattering is much reduced, radiative pressure
can often be neglected. In contrast, if light is tuned away from atomic resonances, the
atom will feel a dipole force originating from the backscattering of photons between
counterpropagating modes.

22.1.1

Linear and ring cavities

We must distinguish two types of cavities with very different behaviors: The linear
cavity or (Fabry-Pérot etalon), where counterpropagating modes form a single mode,
and the ring cavity, where counterpropagating modes have independent photon budgets.
For a linear cavity, boundary conditions imposed by the surfaces of the cavity
mirrors determine the possible spatial mode functions, which are necessarily standing
waves. The amplitudes of the electric field are in second quantization (15.8),
Ê(z, t) = Ê + (z, t)e−ıωt + Ê − (z, t)eıωt

We identify the degrees of freedom of the system through the quantum observables
appearing in the Hamiltonian: the counterpropagating modes of light with the amplitudes (â± ), the internal degrees of freedom (σ̂ z , σ̂ ± ), and the spatial coordinates of
the atom (ẑ, p̂).
In contrast to linear cavities, ring cavities have the following particularities: 1. The
phase of the standing wave is free to move; 2. the counterpropagating modes of the
cavity have independent photon budgets, each backscattering event conserves momentum; 3. the backscattering acts on the phase of the standing wave. Atoms can
be trapped by the dipole force within the cavity mode volume. The dipole force
corresponds to a backscattering of photons between modes.

of freedom (x̂, p̂, â± ) and the possible decay processes (κ, Γ) for the derivation of the field

22.1.2

Eliminating spontaneous emission and cavity decay

In fact, there are more degrees of freedom involved in the dynamics of atoms moving in
a laser-pumped ring cavity, because of the atoms may scatter light into directions other
than the cavity modes by spontaneous emission, and the cavity modes may decay by
transmission through the mirrors. Therefore, we need to treat the respective vacuum
field modes receiving the photons, âk and âω , quantum mechanically and include the
respective Hamiltonians,

Ĥatom:vacuum =
gatom:vacuum â†k σ̂ − e−ık·r̂ + h.c.
(22.5)
k

Ĥcav:bath =

X
ω

in the description of the coupled dynamics. Here, gatom:vacuum denotes the vacuum
Rabi frequency, that is, the coupling strength between the atomic dipole and the
electromagnetic vacuum into which spontaneously emitted photons may escape. On
the other hand, gcav:bath denotes the coupling strength between the cavity mode and
the spectrum of electromagnetic modes into which cavity photons can escape and
which we will from now on call heat bath to facilitate its semantic distinction from the
spontaneous vacuum. The total density operator, the Hamiltonian and the equation
of motion are, consequently,
ρ̄ = ρ̂atom ⊗ ρ̂electron ⊗ ρ̂cav ⊗ ρ̂vacuum ⊗ ρ̂bath

(22.6)

H̄ = Ĥmotion + Ĥelectron + Ĥcav + Ĥatom:cav + Ĥlaser:cav + Ĥatom:vacuum + Ĥcav:bath
ρ̄˙ = −ı[H̄, ρ̄] .
With the inclusion of the vacuum field modes âω and âk the number of degrees of
freedom to be treated literally explodes, and we have to find a way to eliminate them
from the equation of motion. We do this by partially tracing the density operator
over the vacuum field modes using the Weisskopf-Wigner theory,
ρ̃ ≡ Trvacuum Trbath ρ̄ = ρ̂atom ⊗ ρ̂electron ⊗ ρ̂cav .

(22.7)

This allows us to reduce the Hamiltonian Ĥ = H̄ − Ĥatom:vacuum − Ĥcav:bath . The
price to pay is, that the equation of motion for this receives dissipative terms: The
Liouville equation turns into a master equation with the following form,
ρ̂˙ = −ı[Ĥ, ρ̂]

where Ĥ is the Hamiltonian from (22.4). We see that each degree of freedom has its
own loss mechanism. κ for the finite transmission of the resonator mirrors [129, 230] 3 ,
Γ for the spontaneous emission, and γf rc , when we exert a frictional force on the

3 Here, we only consider cavity decay into a zero temperature reservoir without quantum phase
fluctuations.

22.1. CAVITY INTERACTING WITH A SINGLE ATOM
22.1.2.1

741

The problem with spontaneous emission in cavities

The above treatment still is incomplete, if we regard ρ̂ as the atomic Bloch vector. The
reason is that we know what the dissipative Lindbladt terms Lvacuum ρ̃ generated by
spontaneous emission look like for the atomic excitation ρ̂atom , but the Hamiltonian
Ĥatom:vacuum also contains the motional degree of freedom e−ık·r̂ , which is intrinsically
three-dimensional. That is, the dissipative terms also need to describe, how the
motion diffuses in momentum space.
The inclusion of dissipative terms, however, is difficult, because unavoidable photonic recoil violates the supposed one-dimensionality of the atomic motion along the
optical axis. Omnidirectional photonic recoil is also incompatible with the assumption
that the momentum is quantized in multiples of 2~k in the direction of the optical axis.
And finally, if we consider degenerate matter waves, photonic recoil will eject atoms
from a BEC. Even if, neglecting the emission process, we only consider absorption,
we would need a quantization in multiples of 1~k instead of 2~k. In the following, in
order to keep the problem 1D, we will neglect momentum diffusion, i.e. we consider
the simplified Hamiltonian H̃ and discard motional terms from the term Lvacuum ρ̂.
22.1.2.2

Quantum derivation of the CARL equations

To obtain the equations of motion we insert the Hamiltonian (22.4) into the equations
for the field operators, for which the following commutation rules hold, [â± , â†± ] = 1

(22.17)

in the absence of pumping, η+ = 0 = η− .

22.1.3

Adiabatic elimination of the excited state

Under certain conditions, however, the internal and external dynamics occur at very
different time scales, which allows a decoupling of the differential equations 4 . When
the light fields are very detuned from atomic resonances, ∆a  Γ, the internal dynamics of the atoms is very fast, that is, the internal state adapts very rapidly to
the boundary conditions defined by the external state and the state of the light field.
4 In good cavity the limit the degrees of freedom of atomic excitation σ̂ ± drop out of the dynamics,
in the bad cavity limit, the fields â± drop out of the dynamics.

22.1. CAVITY INTERACTING WITH A SINGLE ATOM

743

Therefore, the internal state has no separate dynamics of its own, and we can adiabatically eliminate the internal degrees of freedom. Thus, we can neglect correlations
between degrees of freedom, hâ± σ̂ ± i = hâ± ihσ̂ ± i etc. [485, 226]. The adiabatic elimination of the excited state comes down to treating the atom as a classical antenna.
We obtain the stationary solutions for t → ∞ in the same way as for the optical
Bloch equations [see Eq. (14.99)], assuming in Eq. (22.15),
σ̂˙ − = 0 = σ̂˙ z

(22.18)

where hσ̂ − i = ρ21 . Introducing the position-dependent Rabi frequency of the atom in
the standing wave 5 ,
Ω̂(z) = 2g(eıkẑ â+ + e−ıkẑ â− ) ,

to be considered as classical. On the other hand the quadratic terms Ω† Ω are negligible when they
are small compared to γ 2 or ∆2a .

Radiation pressure and the adiabatically approximated Hamiltonian

The impact of radiation pressure should be considered when the pumping laser is
close to a resonance. Then γ0  U0 is no longer satisfied [226], and we get one more
term from the equation for the atomic force: ∝ ~γ0 (|α+ |2 − |α− |2 ).

as shown in Exc. 22.1.7.3. Note that dissipative terms are (naturally) absent from this
Hamiltonian, so that it shall not be used for the description of radiation pressure. On
the other hand, all coherent terms of the equations of motion can be derived from this
Hamiltonian (22.26), and we can verify momentum conservation (22.17) and deduce
transformation properties.
These equations, which we will call CARL equations for reasons that we will become clear in Sec. 22.2, describe the coupled dynamics of atoms being accelerated by
the kick eıkẑ imparted by the photonic recoil received upon scattering a photon from
one mode into the counterpropagating one. In the same time, the backscattering annihilates a photon â± in one mode and creates a photon â†∓ in the counterpropagating
mode. From now on we will exclusively use the CARL equations.
Finally, let us summarize, how the operators act on states and observables of the
coupled system, noting that the same transformation rules as for free and trapped
atoms (3.121) also hold for the optical lattice,

We have seen in Sec. 22.1.3 how to eliminate the internal atomic degrees of freedom,
once the condition |∆a |  Γ is satisfied. We may try an analogous treatment accounting for the limit |∆c |  κ. In this case, the cavity fields evolve on a fast time

we set,

and obtain from the first Heisenberg equation (22.15),

Alternatively, the coherent part of these equations can be derived by insert â± (∞)
directly in the Hamiltonian (22.4). This will be done in Exc. 22.1.7.5. The equations
(22.36) tell us that, in the absence of cavity decay and spontaneous emission, the
atomic population will not undergo nutation, but the dipole moment will rotate with
a velocity which depends on the inversion. The dynamics becomes interesting in the
presence of several atoms, as studied in 21.3.4.

22.1.5

General rules for deriving equations of motion

We have, in the previous sections, derived Heisenberg equations (22.15), respectively
(22.25) which, together with the Schrödinger equation for the system’s state |ψ(t)i
or the master equation for the density operator ρ̂(t) form an over-complete set. This

746

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

section aims at providing a general recipe for choosing the right set of equations
depending on two basic criteria for the nature of the degrees of freedom involved in
the dynamics: (i) Do judge it necessary to treat the degree of freedom as quantum or
may a classical description be sufficient; and (ii) Is the degree of freedom subject to
dissipation (e.g. spontaneous emission of the electronic excitation, cavity decay of the
field mode, or collisions messing up the center-of-mass motion), or not. The procedure,
which will be applied throughout the remaining part of this chapter, leads to very
different descriptions of the system depending on the specific parameter regime.
1. The procedure is generally applicable to coupled systems: We first need to
identify all relevant degrees of freedom and set up the Hamiltonian, possibly
eliminating irrelevant degrees of freedom, e.g. via adiabatic elimination or by
tracing over them, if they contribute to dissipation. In the context of atoms
coupled to a ring cavity, we assume our system to be in some state 6 ,
|ψ(t)i = |ri ⊗ |α+ i ⊗ |α− i ⊗ |ii ,

(22.37)

coupling the atomic motion, the light fields and the electronic excitation, although the electronic excitation |ii is often eliminated adiabatically. The dissipative degrees of freedom related to vacuum modes leading to spontaneous
emission and cavity decay, as well as collisions between moving atoms are traced
away, but may be considered in the master equation for the density operator
and in the Heisenberg equations, where the corresponding decay rates are added
phenomenologically.
This first item has already been solved in the previous sections and led us to
the Hamiltonian (22.4) and the corresponding Heisenberg equations (22.15),
or the adiabatically approximated Hamiltonian (22.26) and the corresponding
Heisenberg equations (22.25).
2. Now, we must decide which degrees of freedom B can be treated as classical.
Typically, those are highly excited degrees of freedom (e.g. fast velocities of
many photons in a mode). The corresponding operators can be substituted by
their expectation value. Purely classical energy terms in the Hamiltonian can
be ignored and removed. For the degrees of freedom Â we want to treat as
quantum, we chose an appropriate common basis, which can be discrete {|mi}
where m is a complete set of quantum numbers. It can also be continuous {|ri}
or a combination of both {|r, mi}. Now, we need to expand all operators on the
chosen basis.
3. For the quantized degrees of freedom must now decide, whether they all evolve
coherently or whether they are subject to dissipation. In the first case, perform
steps A4 to A7, in the second case, perform steps B4 to B7.
A4. In the case of coherent dynamics, we expand the state of the system |ψ(t)i on
the whole basis. For example, expanded on a partially continuous basis, the
6 Throughout this chapter we will denote momentum states by the Greek letters |µi or νi. Photonic
states will be labeled by the Latin letters |ni or |mi. Electronic excitation states will be labeled by
the Latin letters |ii or |ji. Finally, expansion coefficients cν,i,n+ ,n− of the state or of the density
matrix elements will sometimes be emphasized in red.

excitation state i, and the atomic position r treated in terms of a continuous
wavefunction in space 7 . When we want to treat the atomic motion as being
quantized in discrete momentum states labeled by some integer number µ, we
adopt the notation,
|ψ(t)i =

where hν, α+ , α− , i|ψ(t)i = cν,n+ ,n− ,i (t) are the new expansion coefficients.
A5. Next, we write down the Schrödinger equation for the state |ψ(t)i, insert the
expansion on the basis, and we derive a linear set of equation of motion for the
expansion coefficients ċ{m} (r). This set governs the dynamics of the quantum
degrees of freedom.
A6. The dynamics of the classical degrees of freedom B is obtained by taking the
expectation values of the Heisenberg equations. Here, we need to take care
that the quantum degrees of freedom appearing in the Heisenberg equations are

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

Let us apply the procedure to the simplest case that the electronic excitation has
been adiabatically eliminated and all remaining degrees of freedom can be treated
classical. Then we do not require a Hamiltonian, nor the Schrödinger equation. We
just take the expectation value of the Heisenberg equations (22.25) for all degrees of
freedom which is easy to do, because there is no quantum state to be expanded: we
just can replace the operators by c-numbers,

These totally classical equations, called CARL equations, will be studied in the subsequent sections, while a thorough discussion of partially quantized equations of motion
is postponed to Sec. 22.4.
22.1.5.1

CARL as a beam splitter

Neglecting spontaneous emission, γ0 = 0, cavity pumping, η = 0, cavity decay, κ = 0,
and cavity detuning, ∆c = 0, the CARL equations in the adiabatic approximation
can be derived from the following Hamiltonian,
Ĥ =

U0 â†± â± + U0 (e−2ıkẑ â†+ â− + e2ıkẑ â+ â†− ) ,

(22.42)

and read,
â˙ ± = −ıU0 â± − ıU0 e∓2ıkẑ â∓
p̂˙ = 2ı~kU0 (e−2ıkẑ â†+ â− − e2ıkẑ â+ â†− ) ,

(22.43)

or with the substitution b̂± ≡ â± eıU0 t ,
˙
b̂± = −ıU0 e∓2ıkẑ b̂∓
¨
b̂± = −U02 b̂± − 2k żU0 e∓2ıkẑ b̂∓ ,

(22.44)

we see that, if the motion weren’t a dynamic variable, ẑ˙ = 0, the field amplitudes
would just perform harmonic oscillations.
On the other hand, with the substitution ĉ ≡ â+ eıkẑ + â− e−ıkẑ 8 , the complete
Hamiltonian rephrased as,
Ĥ =

p̂2
+ U0 ĉ† ĉ .
2m

(22.45)

Here, we see that, if the motion described by (ẑ, p̂) weren’t a dynamic variable, our
system would simply be a harmonic oscillator vibrating with the frequency U0 .
8 Provided

we are allowed to commute the operators ẑ and â± .

The equations (22.46) completely describe our coupled atom-cavity system. They
are totally classical and work for both, atoms and macroscopic particles.

Cumulant expansion for CARL

The dynamics of quantum correlations such as â†+ â− or â+ σ + can be derived from
Heisenberg equations, as well. As an example, let us consider the adiabatically eliminated Hamiltonian (22.26) and ignore the quantized nature of the atomic motion,

This is the lowest order cumulant expansion. The expectation values form a system
of 10 linear first order differential equations [105] from which we can calculate the
steady-state of the system.
The correlation functions and spectra are obtained directly from the CARL equation for the cavity fields (22.25) using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem (15.83) and
the quantum regression theorem (15.137). With the substitutions, t → 0, B̂ → 1,
Â → dÂk /dτ , and ξi (τ )Âi (0) → ζi Âi (τ ), the quantum regression theorem can be
written in the form,

22.2

751

CARL: The collective atomic recoil laser

The collective atomic recoil laser (CARL) was first predicted in 1994 [80] as an atomic
analog of FEL. The idea consists of a monochromatic homogeneous beam of moving
two-level atoms (all atoms have the same velocity), a strong counterpropagating pump
laser beam and a weak copropagating probe beam tuned to the blue side of the
resonance. The lasers form a standing light wave that moves in the same direction
as the atoms. Atoms that are faster than the velocity of the standing wave are
rejected by the maxima of the dipolar potential created by the standing wave and feel
a repulsive force. Atoms that are slower than the standing wave velocity are pushed
by the dipole potential maxima and feel an accelerating force. These forces can be
interpreted as backscattering of photons from the pump wave into the probe wave.
This redistribution of energy amplifies the contrast of the stationary wave, which
in turn amplifies the backscattering efficiency, etc. Therefore, the CARL converts
kinetic energy into coherent radiation (or more precisely, into an increase of the energy
difference between probe and pump) mediated by atomic bunching. It is a selfamplifying mechanism. The CARL signature is a transient exponential amplification
for the incident probe, which defines the frequency of the ’CARL laser’.

Figure 22.3: Collective atomic recoil laser.

The first experimental realization of CARL used an annular cavity [372].

22.2.1

Solutions for many mobile atoms

The preceding sections dealt with a single atom in a ring cavity. The most interesting
part of the dynamics, however, only emerge in the presence of several atoms, because
their motion can be become correlated via their simultaneous interaction with the
same two counter-propagating modes of the cavity, as illustrated in the following
movie (watch movie). A talk on CARL can be assisted at (watch talk).
22.2.1.1

Simulation of the dynamics for many perfectly bunched atoms

In experiment we generally deal with many atoms, which means that we have to
extend the equations of motion (22.26) to N atoms via z −→ zj and p −→ pj , where
j = 1, N . This will be done in the next chapter. Here, we will assume for simplicity,
that the atoms are perfectly bunched, zj = z and pj = p. This means that we only
need to consider a single equation of motion for the atoms. However, their coupling
to the cavity modes is N times stronger, which means that we have to substitute
U0 −→ UN ≡ N U0 in the equation of motion for the cavity fields.

752

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

Figure 22.4: In the momentum picture the CARL acceleration process occurs as Ramananti-Stokes processes along the free-particle dispersion relation.

In general, the equations can not be solved analytically, especially when the pump
varies over time. Then we have to iterate numerically the equations,

Analytic approximations for one-sided pumping

Analytical solutions only exist in particular cases. However, they allow a better understanding of the dynamics. So let’s consider some limiting cases. In Exc. 21.3.8.11
we determine the steady state of an atom interacting with the modes of a unidirectionally pumped annular cavity. In Exc. 21.3.8.12 we calculate the stationary position of
the atom in a unidirectionally pumped ring cavity. In Exc. 21.3.8.13 we derive motion
∗
∗
equations for the ’intensities’ α± α±
and ’coherences’ α± α∓
.
When only one atom is in the cavity or when the atoms are perfectly bunched
together, it is possible to derive analytical solutions. Particularly interesting is the
following situation: We pump the cavity from one side. The pump is supposed to
be dominant and locked to a resonance, such that we can neglect the feedback of the
system on the pump, that is, we can assume, α+ = η/κ. Using the abbreviations
9 Note, that there is also a radial motion of the atom coupled to the axial movement. The coupling
happens, because the axial motion influences the number of intracavity photons of the radiation field
which, in turn, determines the depth of the dipole potential.

(22.56)

This means that the CARL frequency, that is, the frequency difference between the
emitted probe wave and the incident light, increases temporarily. The frequency
corresponds to the double Doppler shift. As the frequency of the probe light gradually
shifts away from the cavity resonance, the probe light finally stops being amplified,
and the amplitude of the probe field decreases: CARL is only a transient phenomenon.
In fact, the behavior described by the equation (22.55) was observed in experiments
[371].
22.2.1.3

Optical instability in ring cavities

We have until now concentrated on the regime of weak coupling, N U0 < 1. If the
pump laser is tuned closer to resonance, or if the number of atoms is increased, so
that N U0 > 1, we observe instabilities in the coupled atom-field dynamics, which
critically depend on the pump intensities [459]. Imagine a sample of atoms trapped
in an optical lattice formed by a symmetrically pumped ring cavity, η+ = η− . The
system is stationary, the atoms are confined at the antinodes of the standing wave,
the light fields are equal in strength, α+ = α− . At time t = 0 we suddenly reduce
the pump rate η− of the non-stabilized mode by only a few percent. The response
of the system observed in experiment [459] is to completely break down the field α− .
The disappearance of the standing wave ejects most atoms and reduces N U0 , until
the coupling gets so weak that the dynamics is essentially governed by the injected
fields. The system recovers a stationary state, with much less atoms.
The physical explanation for the instability is reminiscent to the CARL behavior
described in previous sections. Because atom-field coupling is strong, a small imbalance of the injected beam intensities is sufficient to displace the atoms to a location,

Figure 22.5: (code) Dynamics simulated with equations (22.46). At time κt = 0 the pump
rate η− is reduced by 1%. After a certain time that depends on N U0 , the standing wave
breaks down ejecting atoms from the mode volume. Here, we simulate this via an artificial
linear trap loss process setting in at time κt = 15. As a result of the diminishing N U0 the
standing wave recovers.

where the light which they scatter into the reverse direction interferes destructively
with the injected light. A simple argument explains, why the standing wave is attracted towards a position where it gets unstable. We treat the imbalance η+ > η−
as if it was due to a scatterer fixed in space inside the mode volume sitting on an
edge of the standing wave (corresponding to a π/4 phase shift), such that it only
scatters light from α+ into α− , but not the other way round. Whether the phase of
the standing wave adjusts itself to that of pump field or such that the scatterer sits at
the bottom of the potential well depends on the ratio of the coupling to the external
field (given by κ) and to the scatterer (given by U0 ). If U0 is stronger, the field is
pulled towards the scatterer dragging along the atoms which are free to move. The
stationary situation is therefore a displacement of the standing wave and the atoms
by λ/4, which is just the position where the cavity field α− and the injected field
(in)
α− are out of phase. The injected light is not transmitted through the cavity any
more.
Note that the instability occurs in a plane wave situation, there is no need to
consider the transversal motion. Furthermore, it is a single-atom effect, since we
assume perfect bunching. We may therefore consider a single atom strongly coupled to
the cavity and use the set of equations (22.46). In the undepleted pump approximation
we assume α̇+ = 0, and if the atom adiabatically follows the dynamics of the potential
valley, ẍ = 0, so that,

Example 95 (Locking of the pump laser ): In practice the resonant frequency

lock the pump laser on a cavity mode, e.g. using the Pound-Drever-Hall method.
This means,
η+
α+ =

(22.60)
κ
In the presence of atoms, however, the resonant frequency can be shifted due to
the refractive index of the atomic cloud [202]. Moreover, the shift depends on the
atomic bunching and consequently varies during the dynamics of the CARL. The
way the locking circuit works, is to continuously adjust the detuning between the
laser and the cavity ∆c (defined for the empty cavity) such as to maximize the
amplitude of the field |α+ | and, hence, the transmission of the cavity filled with
atoms. The dynamics of the detuning must be incorporated by an additional
equation modeling the action of locking. Now that we know the effect, which
an ideal lock should have, we can apply the boundary condition (22.60) and
eliminate the pump mode α+ from the dynamics of the system. That is, the
following equations are usually sufficient to describe the CARL:

The maxima of |α+ (∞)|2 as a function of ∆c give the shifted resonances of the

Locking on transverse modes

We already mentioned that as the CARL accelerates, the frequency of the light which
is backscattered to the probe shifts to the red until it escapes from the resonant
mode. What happens if we provide another resonant mode that can receive photons?
We will show in the following calculation, that CARL simply picks up the closest

The eigenvalues of the matrix are e = ıω, ıω 1 − µN . Therefore, we expect, in

(22.74)
We find splitting in the strong coupling regime, g > Γ, but we consider the weak
coupling regime, g < Γ, to implement the phononic coupling.

22.2.2.1

Probing the phonon spectrum

To probe the phonon spectrum, we can measure (or simulate) the oscillation of a
single atom xm (t) in the presence of several atoms. The Fourier spectrum of the
oscillation should reveal the frequency components of the center-of-mass motion Z(t)
and the relative motion. This is actually observed and discussed earlier.
An alternative method for observing normal modes would be to excite an atomic
motion and look for a resonant enhancement of the vibration amplitude near the
secular frequency, ωφ ≈ ωcm , ω0 . For an empty cavity, we expect a low-pass behavior
as discussed in Sec. 21.1.2: The modulation frequencies ωφ  κ are not transformed
into phase oscillations θ. However, if the atomic motion can act back on the field,
then we expect a resonant enhancement. The atomic vibration can be excited by an
external force, for example, by RIR resonances, superimposed on the field gradient of
the cavity,

(22.75)
or by modulating the pump field,
η(t) = ηe±ıφ0 sin ωφ t .

(22.76)

Fig. 22.7(a,b) shows a typical resonance curve obtained by plotting the maximum
transfer of energy to the atoms as a function of the modulation frequency of the
phase of the pump field.
Fig. 22.7(c,d) shows the same typical resonance curve, but taken here the atoms
were subjected to a periodic external force. The phase does show a dispersive frequencydependence θ(ω) if η ' κ. If the pumping is too strong, η  κ, the phase does not
exhibit any resonant enhancement. Even though the phase-oscillations are suppressed
as ωφ is increased, the atomic center-of-mass motion is excited, when the secular resonance, ωφ = ωcm , is met. The other modes ω0 are not excited. Also the powerimbalance of the beams |α+ |2 − |α− |2 always has a strong resonant enhancement.

The simulations have been done for the two situations that 1. the laser was not
locked to the cavity resonance, but fixed to ∆c = 0,
Pand 2. the laser was locked to
the cavity resonance, which means ∆c = (1 + N −1 | m e−ıkzm |)N U0 ≈ 2N U0 . This
second case is shown in the blue curves in Figs. 22.7(a) to (d). The simulation exactly
reproduces the expected deviation of the resonance frequency ωcm from the secular
frequency ω0 (22.74). Obviously, at ∆c ' 2N U0 the shift of the CoM mode can not be
observed via its resonant enhancement. We can excite the CoM, but at the unshifted
frequency ω0 . At ∆c ' 0 where the shift occurs, we can not lock the laser 11 .

Collective effects

To understand the dynamics of CARL we must understand how atomic ensembles
commonly interact with light modes. Let us first consider two atoms: The generalization of the fundamental equations (22.46) to two atoms is,

called bunching parameter vanishes, it means that the atomic density distribution is
homogeneous. So, the phases of randomly scattered photons destructively interfere,
and the impact of the scatterers on the light modes cancels out.
On the other side, when atoms accumulate in the antinodes of the standing wave, it
increases the contrast of it can spread more efficiently collectively by Bragg scattering.
The particularity of the CARL is that during the temporal evolution the bunching
process can amplify itself leading to an exponential growth of the counterpropagant
mode, accompanied by an increasingly pronounced self-bunching.

Phenomena related to CARL

The collective atomic recoil laser (CARL) unifies the principles of the FEL and LWI.
Assume two-level atoms in their ground state moving against the pump beam k2 .
An (at first) weak probe beam k1 which is blue detuned with respect to k2 builds
a together with k2 a standing wave fraction moving in direction v. This fraction
gives rise to a moving dipole potential V (r) and a light force on the atoms. If the
moving standing wave is slower than the atoms (and the light frequency detuning
from the atomic resonance is suitable), the atoms fall into the potential valleys by
rescattering photons from the pump into the probe wave. This way they amplify the
probe (they push the ponderomotive wave like the FEL), deepen the light potential
valleys, are therefore further focused, etc.. We get a self-amplifying avalanche and
feedback. In this process, the kinetic energy of the atoms is transformed into laser
light. Or to resume: Collective recoil with self-bundeling produced by cooperative
Compton-scattering generates coherent laser light [80].
The following notes first discuss the basic equations of motion in the limit of very
far detuning, where the internal dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated. Then we
turn our attention to some characteristic features of CARL.

764

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

22.3.1

Recoil-induced resonances

The recoil-induced resonances (RIR) can be explained in two complementary pictures
[139]. In the Raman picture, an atomic transition stimulates Raman transitions
between momentum states of the free atom without influencing the atomic excitation
(the atom remains in a dark state) ρatom ⊗ |pihp + 2~k|. Absorption ∆ > 0 or
amplification ∆ > 0 of the probe field ks by the pump field kp is a result of the
population imbalance. However, it is not an excitation imbalance (compare LWI)
ρatom ⊗ |p + 2~kihp + 2~k| − ρatom ⊗ |pihp|. In the Rayleigh picture the RIRs are
an effect of coherent backward Bragg scattering of the probe wave at the phase-lag
between the induced light-shift grating and the atomic density grating resulting from
the periodic optical potential.

thus modifying the amplitudes Ei so that a signal occurs.

From symmetry considerations, it is easy to see that a homogeneous density distribution (along q) of the motionless atoms does not give rise to a signal, neither. So

Regarding the momentum transfer, the 4WM process can be interpreted as Bragg
scattering af the atoms at one of the two counterpropagating standing waves. We
develop the theory if Bragg scattering in Sec. 28.2.
22.3.1.2

Temperature measurements via RIR

Temperature measurement are usually carried out by the time-of-flight method followed by absorption imaging. Alternatively, one can perform spectroscopy of RIR
resonances. In the latter case, we detect intensity variations in a probe laser beam,
i.e. the polarisation of the sample under the influence of all irradiated laser beams.
In Sec. 13.3.6, we have seen that α ∝ Im χ ∝ Im P ∝ Im ρ12 . It is thus sufficient
to calculate the atomic coherences, if necessary including the motional states of the
atoms. Calculated by [262]

RIR-spectroscopy on trapped atoms

In the case of free particles, the Raman beams interact for every detuning with a
different velocity class of atoms. The atoms are almost not disturbed. In the case of
trapped atoms, a coherence can be excited, and since the atoms periodically change
their velocity, be read out or reexcited at a later time. The same atom can thus
interact with the Raman beams at different times/detunings. If the trap is a standing
wave, the situation is complicated by the fact that there are two overlapping gratings:
The standing wave and the Raman grating. However, if the trap is much deeper than
the Raman grating the atoms can be considered as localized.
The signature of atomic oscillation is a modulation in the RIR signal with the
periodicity of the secular frequency [366, 509].

766

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

Let us consider a standing-wave dipole-trap with ωz = 2π × 700 kHz, ωr = 2π ×
1 kHz and Udip = h × 30 MHz = 4000 × 2ε = 45ωz = 2100ωz . The 100 µK cold atoms
are therefore deep inside at the bottom of trap. This implies that the atomic energy
levels are sharp and equally distant, and that the transitions are degenerate upon
coupling by Raman-beams. If we apply a scan of ±2π × 300 kHz, we will not excite
the longitudinal motion. But the radial motion can be excited. As seen earlier the
absorption signal is α ∝ Im ρ12 . What happens to the coherence, if the radiation is
swept across a resonance depends on the scanning speed. If the scan is slow, we expect
α ∝ Im ρ12 (∞). We should be able to resolve the resonances [262, 264, 263] as peaks
at ±ωr , ±2ωr , ... In contrast, if the scan is fast, as long as ∆c is far from resonance,
the population of the excited level ρ22 is just too small and nothing happens. When
∆c passes through 0, the coherence ρ12 is excited, and can now be driven by the laser
even when ∆c is tuned far away. The coherence precesses faster and faster.
Let us compare to the situation of a laser swept across an electric dipole resonance. In analogy to the cavity response in reflection to a laser scanned across an
eigenfrequency, we might expect a ringing coming from interference of the radiating
electric dipole (which has been induced while the laser was close to resonance) with
the original laser frequency. The radiated electric field is proportional to the excited
state population. If we allow for a change of the input field, for example ∆c (t), the
Bloch-equations must be numerically integrated,
ρ(t + dt) = ρ(t) + dt M ρ(t) .

(22.90)

It is already clear that we should expect a ringing with exactly the time-dependent
frequency ∆c (t). Fig. 22.11 shows

is swept across resonance. The parameters are Γ = 2π × 8 kHz, Ω = 0.2Γ, ∆ = −50Γ..50Γ
and t = −150..150 µs.

This simple mathematical model only assumes a resonance with a given width
and a frequency-scanned oscillator. The physical nature of the resonance and the
level splitting are not specified and the formalism should be applicable to a variety of
situations. A ringing is, in fact, observed for RIR scans, if the scanning speed is too
fast, in particular for atoms trapped in optical lattices. Ringing can also be generated
in classical harmonic oscillators and laser-driven two-level systems as we will see in
Exc. 28.5.4.1.

RIR versus CARL

The dynamics is characterized by backaction of the atomic motion onto the cavity
field. In this respect there is a connection to RIR resonances in the limit investigated
by [367]. While normal RIR is the action of the atomic motion on light fields, they
demonstrate that in the same time the Raman-lattice influences the atomic motion.
The coherence is limited by the time the photon spends in the sample (similar to
the limitation of superradiant Rayleigh scattering, without photonic recycling by a
ring-cavity). Real backaction in the sense of coherent interdependence of the photonic
and the kinetic degrees of freedom requires recycling of the photons.

22.3.2

FEL: the free electron laser

Normal lasers work by an inversion in the internal degrees of freedom, that is, bound
electrons are excited to energetically higher orbitals, from where they can decay by
emitting monochromatic light of well-defined frequency. Because, the free electron
laser (FEL) works with beams of free electrons, they are tunable over wide frequency
ranges. They have much higher efficiencies above 65%.
The principle is the following: Relativistic electrons are guided through an undulator, which is a device producing a magnetic field with periodically alternating
polarization. Here, the electrons are subjected to a Lorentz force, F = −ev × B,
forcing the electrons to oscillate with the periodicity of the undulator field. This corresponds to a dipole moment interacting with the incident light field. The transverse
velocity of the electrons within the magnetic field of an incident light produces a
Lorentz force in the axial direction called ponderomotive force. This force accelerates
the electrons when they are a bit slower than the ponderomotive wave. Otherwise the
electrons are decelerated. In the second case, the energy of the electrons is transmitted
to the light field, which leads to a bunching of the atoms. Because it is a parametric
process, there is a continuous energy flow between the field and the motion of the e−
(analogous to parametric Raman cooling). Thus, the FEL converts the kinetic energy
of the electron beam into laser radiation. The inversion in a FEL can be interpreted
as a relative displacement of the probability distributions for absorption and emission
of photons in momentum space,
Wabs (∆) = sinc 2 21 (∆ + ε/2)
Wabs (∆) =

sinc2 12 (∆

(22.91)

− ε/2) ,

where ε = ~k 2 /2me . The gain is a convolution of the difference of the above distribution with the momentum distribution of the electrons [560].
There various kinds of FELs. In stimulated Compton FELs, described by the
shown Feyman graphs, the electrons are scattered by virtual (momentum transfer
without energy transfer) photons of the wiggler. In Bremsstrahlungs FEL, the electrons are scattered at a static field. Virtual photons of the static field are scattered
at the electrons, who then emit Bremsstrahlung an change their propagation direction. In Raman FELs very dense electron beams produce charge density oscillations,
which provides an additional effect. Free Electron Lasers already have a wide range
of application ranging from biology and medicine to lithography and material science.

Bonifacio et al. [81] suggested to study collective atomic recoil lasing (CARL) with
relativistic atoms. They found that using very fast atoms it should, in principle, be
possible to get large CARL frequency shifts and much higher power enhancement
factors than observed in free-electron lasers (FEL). Relativistic atomic velocities can
be achieved in heavy ion accelerators such as the GSI heavy ion accelerator in Darmstadt and TSR ion storage ring in Heidelberg. Therefore the question arises, if CARL
could be an alternative way to produce very energetic and intense UV radiation in
concurrence to the FEL. In fact, CARL-based systems may prove more powerful and
versatile as their electronic counterparts: Cooling techniques based on electron beams
or on hybrid optical-radiofrequency friction forces are able to cool the ionic beams
down to mK temperatures.
The CARL which has been predicted ten years ago by Bonifacio et al. [80], has
recently been observed with cold atoms stored in a high-finesse ring cavity [372, 631].
This proof of principle, now may motivate a deeper study of the figure of merit of a
relativistic CARL. This short note, however, shows that a relativistic CARL is still,
in my opinion, far from being realizable.

22.3.4

Matter wave superradiance

There is a close relationship between CARL and the phenomenon of matter wave
superradiance (or superradiant Rayleigh scattering) [79, 539], which will be discussed
in the following sections.
In 1999 the group of W. Ketterle at the MIT made a surprising observation, when
it illuminated an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate with a short linearly polarized
laser pulse traversing the condensate perpendicularly to the long axis [313]DOI . Instead of producing radiation with a dipole pattern, as we might expect for a polarized
atomic cloud undergoing Rayleigh scattering, they observed emission of directional
light bursts along the symmetry axis of the condensate. They also observed that some
of the atoms were accelerated at angles of 45◦ . And these atoms could emit other
generations of atoms at angles of 45◦ .
The phenomenon was explained as follows. Let us imagine a first photon scattered
by an atom into the direction of the long axis of the condensate. This atom will be
accelerated by the photonic recoil in a direction of 135◦ with respect to the direction
of the photon, and it will interfere with the rest of the condensate thus generating

a standing matter wave of oriented in such a way, that the following photons are
scattered into the same direction as the first one via Bragg scattering. This reinforces
the contrast of the matter wave, etc.. We obtain an exponential gain of photons in
the mode defined by the first scattered photon, as well as of the mode receiving the
scattered matter wave. As the path of the gain is longer along the long axis of the
condensate, this mode is favored. That is, the condensate can be considered as a
cavity embracing the solid angle Ωsol .
The Rayleigh scattering rate for a single atom is,
R1 = sin2 θσ(∆a )

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

22.4

Quantization of the atomic motion in cavities

At the beginning of this chapter we set up the complete Hamiltonian of the coupled
atom-cavity system. Then tracing over dissipative degrees of freedom, we derived the
master equation or derived the Heisenberg equations for the operators appearing in
the remaining Hamiltonian quantum mechanically. But then for CARL we restricted
to a classical treatment of the motion, as well as of the cavity modes.
Resuming the discussion started in Sec. 22.1.5 we will, in the remaining sections of
this chapter, analyze effects due to the quantization of degrees of freedom represented
by operators. The present section will (i) on a quantum description of the motion
(with and without adiabatic elimination of the internal atomic dynamics and (ii) on
issues arising from the presence of many atoms.

22.4.1

Quantum description of the motion

Concretely, let us analyze again the situation of a single atom interacting with a
ring cavity. We assume validity of the adiabatic elimination of the internal atomic
excitation and want to treat the light fields as classical. In contrast, the atomic motion
is considered as quantum:
|ψi = |zimotion ⊗ |α+ i ⊗ |α− i

classical

⊗ |iielectron

adiab.elim.

→ |zi .

(22.94)

Since the motion, being the only quantum degree of freedom, is not subject to dissipation, we may use the Schrödinger equation in addition to Heisenberg equations for
the light fields. Then, following the procedure outlined in Sec. 22.1.5, with z being
the only quantum number, we find that the system is completely described by the
dynamics of the expansion coefficients,

12 Terms of the Hamiltonian (22.26) which do not depend on z or p have been ignored, as they can
be removed form the Schrödinger equation by a simple unitary transformation. Note that this can
be done even though these terms depend on the field amplitudes α± .

These are the new CARL equations that should be used in cases when the particle is
slower than the recoil velocity, in which its motion must be described as a propagating
matter wave. Note, that under this form, the equations can easily be generalized to
apply to macroscopic wavefunctions such as a Bose-Einstein condensate.
The expectation value of the particle’s position is then calculated via,

22.4.1.1

About the origin of quantized motion

The quantization of the light field into photons is, as discussed in Chp. 15.7.1, an
intrinsic property of light. In contrast, the quantization of atomic motion is less
obvious, because the atoms are not confined in a trapping potential. The reason for
it lies in the monochromaticity of the driving laser fields and the one-dimensional
geometry of the system, which allow us to write the recoil operator (2.189) or (3.124)
as,
Z
e2ıkẑ = |p + 2~kihp|dp .
(22.101)
Inserting it into the interaction part of the CARL Hamiltonian,
Ĥint = U0 (e−2ıkẑ â†+ â− + e2ıkẑ â+ â†− ) ,
the Schrödinger equation for the expanded wavefunction

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

That is, if the initial momentum distribution is narrow, ∆p  2~k, and if CARLinduced recoil due to backscattering of photons between counterpropagating modes
is the only force acting on the atoms, the momentum of the atoms can only adopt
discrete values in units of 2~k, as if the atomic velocity were quantized. That is, the
quantization of the field is, in some way, imprinted on the distribution of the atomic
moment, so that we may as well use a discrete notation,
|ψi =
such that

Now, it is important to understand that the statement that photonic recoil is
quantized does not mean that the dipolar optical force can only be transmitted in units
of 2~k, as if the force needed to accumulate a certain amount of energy before it
makes a sudden transition to a different momentum state. Rather, the probability to
find an initially resting atom subject to a force in the momentum state 2~k gradually
increases with time. The atom gradually evolves into a coherent superposition of
states |0i + |2~ki + |4~ki + .., and only when we measure the momentum distribution
will it have to decide in which state it ended up. The expectation value of the centerof-mass momentum linearly, as long as the force is constant. A slide show on the
quantized CARL can be viewed at (watch talk).

22.4.2

Discretization of the momentum states

We will now assume that, for the physical reasons described above, the motional
state of the atom can only exist with momenta corresponding to multiples of twice
the photonic recoil.
13 Note that, instead of expanding the state |ψi, we could expand the motional wavefunction into
plane waves,

Quantization of the atomic motion without adiabatic
elimination

So far we have discussed the quantization of the atomic motion in the CARL equations, which were obtained by adiabatic elimination of the electronically excited state.
In the following, we will quantize the motion directly in the equations of motion
(22.15) for the observables and in the Liouville equation for the density operator. We
quantize the atomic motion along the optical z-axis simply by assuming that, in this
direction, the momentum only exists in multiples of ~k, and organize up the Hilbert
space like this,

considered, we may switch to a classical description of the motion, as done in (22.46).
In the case of very cold (below the recoil limit) but still independent atoms, we may
assume that they all are coherently distributed over the same momentum states. We
may then apply a unique momentum state expansion for all atoms, as shown in the
subsequent section.
If on the other hand quantum statistics play a role, then we need to replace
the wavefunction in the Schrödinger equation (22.96) by field operators, as done in
Sec. 28.5. In the following sections, we will restrict to single atoms that can be in
a coherent superposition of momentum states or many atoms in a matter wave that
can be treated as a c-number, e.g. a Bose-condensate without fluctuations.

Modal expansion of the motion of many independent atoms in

Our starting point is the quantum version of the CARL equations (22.25), where we
neglect spontaneous emission, γ0 = 0. Setting α+ = η+ /κ and η− = 0 we get,

when ∆c → 0.√The characteristic equation reduces to λ3 = −1, yielding the solutions

G = 12 ωr ρ 3
∆ωG ' ωr ρ  κc , ωr .

(22.145)

The gain bandwidth ∆ωG being much larger than the recoil frequency, the Bragg condition for scattering between different momentum states is approximately fulfilled for
a large number of initial momenta. I.e. although the momentum transfer is quantized,
∆c = nωr , the atoms can be accelerated to high velocities. From Eq. (22.138)(a) we
see |D̄µ /B̄µ | = ρ|λ̄|  1, i.e. %µ,µ+1 ' %µ−1,µ .
In the superradiant regime, κ > 1, of the semiclassical
limit the characteristic

In fact, the relative gain bandwidth is on the order of ∆ωG /ωr ' ρ ∝ nN U02

Since recoil can be neglected we can have absorption or emission. The gain results
from the difference bewteen the average rates of both.

model in Sec. 15.2 and of cooperative scattering in Sec. 21.3, however, without addressing the issue of atomic motion which, via photonic recoil, inevitably influences
the dynamics. We also started a discussion on the role of photonic recoil in Sec. 19.3,

Concretely, we will be using the Hamiltonian (22.26), obtained after adiabatic

22.5.1

QED in ring cavities

Macroscopic high-finesse ring cavities interacting with a cloud of cold atoms allowed
to enter the regime of strong collective coupling. However, new interesting aspects
arise from the regime of strong coupling on the level of individual atoms.
Todays research projects on cold atoms in cavities are essential divided into two
classes, each class realizing an opposite regime: Cavity quantum electrodynamics
(CQED) experiments as they are done by the groups of Rempe [373] and Kimble use
microcavities having mode volumes so small that few photons give rise to macroscopic
field strength. In such cavities the atom-field coupling is made to exceed all other
decay rates. The other regime is that of cavity-cooling mainly investigated by Vuletic
at the MIT and, in the case of ring cavities, of the collective atomic recoil laser
(CARL) realized in the Tübingen research group. In this second regime the cavities
are so large that the light fields can be considered as classical.
An interesting question is, whether the two regimes can be married to realize a
system, where collective effects and entanglement between optical and atomic modes
can be observed. The central idea is not to increase the coupling strength by reducing
the mode volume, but to reduce the decay rates, in particular the natural linewidth
of the atomic transition by choosing an atomic species that can be laser-cooled on a
narrow intercombination line.
Example 101 (CQED by reducing the ring cavity mode volume): Technically a ring cavity design with (w, L, F ) = (30 µm, 4 cm, 200000) is feasible.
This is enough to get below the critical atom number, but this is not sufficient
to get into the CQED regime. Reducing Γ seems unavoidable.
The isotope 88 Sr posses a narrow transition which can be used for optical cooling.
The following table compares the various systems, i.e. a CQED example taken
from Rempe, the macroscopic ring cavity with rubidium used in our Tübingen
CARL experiments and a cavity tuned close to the strontium intercombination
line.

Description of quantized light fields in cavities

In order to calculate the evolution of photon distributions in the counter-propagating
modes â± of a ring cavity, we develop CARL in a Fock basis. For simplicity, we first
consider the motion of a single atom as classical and fixed (i.e. not as a degree of
freedom), and we apply the adiabatic approximation. I.e. we have only two quantized
degrees of freedom, which we organize like,

Note that the master equation using the Lindbladt operator traces over the reservoir. Hence, the master equation only treats the cavity modes, but does not allow predictions on the quantum behavior of outcoupled fields. In order to describe
e.g. quantum correlations in output field, one needs an input-output theory [129, 230].

Photon backscattering for fixed atomic position

To tackle the problem of quantized light field we first assume an atom fixed in space,
that is, we completely disregard the motional degree of freedom by setting p̂ = 0 and
restricting to the Hamiltonian,
X
Ĥ =
ω± â†± â± − ıη± (â± − â†± ) + U0 (â†+ â− e−2ıkẑ + â†− â+ e2ıkẑ ) .
(22.154)
±

In Exc. 22.5.7.1 we show how to cast the Hamiltonian into a matrix form using an
appropriate basis already used in the discussion of the beam splitter in the photon
representation in Sec. 15.6.1.
In Exc. 22.5.7.2(a) we derive the equations of motion for the components cn+ ,n− of
the state vector from the Schrödinger equation cavity decay. In Exc. 22.5.7.3(a) we derive the equations of motion for the components ρm+ ,n+ ;m− n− = hm+ , m− |ρ̂|n+ , n− i
of the density operator. Simulations performed based on these equations of motion
are shown in Fig. 22.21).
The simulations reveal a number of interesting facts:
 The field amplitudes |α± |2 execute oscillations due to CARL coupling, but with
preserved Poissonian shape of the photon number distributions.
 When simulations are done with initial Fock states, they eventually relax to a
Glauber state.
 The mean photon numbers and the atomic coordinates evolve in a continuous
way.

These observations are not surprising, once we understood the backscattering as
a linear coupling between the modes being mediated by a beam splitter Hamiltonian

fication of the coherent photon statistics. On the contrary, as shown in Sec. 15.6.1, a
beam splitter tends to transform sub-Poissonian states into Poissonian ones. In fact,
CARL is nothing else than a movable beam splitter.
Non-linearity may come into play, if photonic recoil is included, i.e. if the atomic
motion itself becomes a degree of freedom. This is the next step of our problem, that
needs to be solved.

22.5.4

Quantized light fields and quantized recoil

The simulations of the preceding section show that the CARL Hamiltonian (22.155),
despite the appearance of photon creation and annihilation operator, does not request
recoil to be quantized: If an arbitrary momentum kick of the atom can be absorbed
by the light fields, then an arbitrary dipole force can be transmitted to the atomic
momentum! The momentum conservation law (22.17) does not imply quantization of

22.5. QUANTIZED LIGHT INTERACTING WITH ATOMS MOVING IN CAVITIES789
photonic recoil. The question is now, how to conceal this fact with the observation of
discrete momentum sidemodes [578]. We have seen earlier, that the quantization of
the motion is transferred from the quantized photon fields via the operator (22.101)
to the atom: An initially resting atom can only adopt motional states with momenta
equal to a multiple of 2~k.
We will now take the quantization of the atomic momentum for granted and study
quantized light modes coupled by recoiling atoms, we extend our Hilbert space like,

CHAPTER 22. ATOMIC MOTION IN OPTICAL CAVITIES

However, the mere inclusion of a third degree of freedom coupled to the other two
degrees in the same linear fashion will modify the behavior of the system, which will
continue to oscillate as it did before, now just involving the atomic motion in this
dynamics. This behavior can only change, when we additionally consider the force
equation,
p̂˙ = 2~kU0 (â†+ â− e−2ıkz − â+ â†− e2ıkz ) ,
(22.163)

Note that, in contrast to CARL equations, the fully quantized equations (22.160)
are linear. That is, it is the ’classization’ 18 of the degrees of freedom which introduces the non-linearities, which are typical for CARL, e.g. the feedback introduced by
classical light fields. The process of ’classization’ corresponds to tracing over degrees
of freedom, which we want to treat classically and thus remove from the Hamiltonian.

22.5.5

Kicking and forcing an atom in a ring cavity

The question we want to elucidate here is, how a coupled atom-ring cavity system
reacts to a kick transferring an arbitrary amount of momentum to the atom. We studied a similar question when studying the kicking of a harmonic oscillator in Sec. 3.6.2,
however, the situation is quite different now because, in contrast to the harmonic
oscillator, the motion of an atom subject to CARL dynamics is not localized and,
hence, not quantized. That is, an arbitrarily kicked atom is not bound to join one of
those momentum states it would populate when kicked by photonic recoil. Hence, a
momentum state expansion like (22.105) is not appropriate, so that we have to go a
step back and consider the Hamiltonian (22.26) again. See also (watch talk).

Kicking

operators, the Hamiltonian and the system’s state like,
Â −→ e−ıqẑ Âeıqẑ

,

|ψi −→ eıqẑ |ψi

(22.178)

and in particular,
Ĥ −→ e−ıqẑ Ĥeıqẑ = Ĥ(ẑ, p̂ − ~q)

,

hp|ψi −→ hp|eıqẑ |ψi = hp − ~q|ψi . (22.179)

We remind that this equations contains CARL feedback via the simultaneous presence
of ẑ and p̂. If we want to disregard the CARL force (assuming, for example, that the
motion is totally imposed by an external force, as done in Sec. 21.3.7 in order to focus
on the behavior of the light fields), we must not project the Schrödinger equation on
hp| but treat the motional degree of freedom as classical.

Quantized equations of motion

In both cases, ’kicking’ and ’forcing’, we may discretize momentum space, although
in the latter case we need to transform back into the lab frame after having solved
the Schrödinger equation (22.160).

22.5.6

Quantum correlations

Superradiant or CARL scattering exist due to a correlation of subsequent scattering
events. In the quantum regime, the emergence of quantum correlations, such as
entanglement and squeezing is to be expected as a consequence of CARL dynamics
[444, 492, 507, 499, 500, 625, 126, 127, 128]. The advantage of doing CARL with BECs
is the possibility to exploit the instability in the good-cavity regime to parametrically
amplify optical and matter waves, manipulate matter wave coherence properties and
generate entanglement.
For the description of the dynamics of the fields, i.e. the momentum sidemodes
and the cavity modes, a first-quantized treatment of the atomic motion [494] would
be sufficient. All information can be extracted from a numerical simulation of the
quantum CARL equations. However, here we are also interested in quantum correlations. Hence, in a first-quantized treatment of the atomic motion, the coefficients
ĉn must be treated as field operators. Alternatively, we derive the basic equations
rigorously from a second-quantized treatment.

22.5. QUANTIZED LIGHT INTERACTING WITH ATOMS MOVING IN CAVITIES795
22.5.6.1

Generation of squeezing and entanglement via CARL

An experiment by [510] produces squeezing in transmission of a cavity resonantly
interacting with single atoms. The effect was induced by vacuum Rabi-splitting. In
our case we have a ring cavity, we operate far from equilibrium, we have classical
Stark splitting. Hence, we may expect squeezing and entanglement from the CARL
dynamics.

Figure 22.23: Production and detection of squeezing.

Differences between entanglement and correlation (correlations involve time or
space coordinates g(τ ), particles correlate across space and time, coherence).
Bragg scattering of light at an atomic grating (or simply the splitting of light at a
beam splitter) is an irreversible process (see Sec. 15.6). CARL can be interpreted in
terms of Bragg scattering of light at an atomic grating, which is generated itself by
the Bragg scattering. Hence, the scattering of early photons influences the scattering
of late photons, i.e. the scattering processes get correlated, the dynamics gets a history. The correlation between subsequent scattering processes is what preserves the
coherence in CARL and superradiant Rayleigh scattering.
It is now interesting to ask how this classical correlations will behave in the quantum regime, i.e. upon 1. quantization of the motion of individual atoms and upon 2.
quantization of atomic particle field. Following [444, 443, 446, 445, 492, 493, 499, 500],
non-classical correlations such as entanglement of matter wave modes, and entanglement between matter-wave and optical modes is expected.
22.5.6.2

Quantum non demolition measurements with CARL

According to [500], a ring cavity could lend itself to quantum non demolition measurements. They consider our ring cavity being pumped from both sides through an
incoupling mirror. A so-called pump mode is injected with a p-polarized light field,
and a probe mode with a s-polarized light field. The light of the probe mode leaking
through a mirror gives information about the atoms (e.g. via the refraction index).
The counterpropagating pump light gives access to higher-order moments of the atom
distribution.
The problem is that the effect is based on photon exchange between the modes,
and those are orthogonally polarized. Even more problematic is that, in practice,
the modes have different frequencies. Other work on this subject has been done by
[31, 197, 419, 420, 112].

Statistical and
thermodynamic approaches to
CARL
The CARL phenomenon introduced in the previous chapter raises a variety of questions, such as: How does it compare to an ordinary laser? Is there a phase transition?
Of what kind would be this transition (in the Ehrenfest or Landau classification
scheme)? What are the coherence properties (measured by correlation functions)?
How do these properties depend on the random motion (temperature) of the atoms?
These issues will be addressed in this chapter and in the later chapter within the
models of Langevin, Fokker-Planck, Vlasov, and Kuramoto.

23.1

The Langevin model

23.1.1

CARL with damping

We saw in the previous chapter that CARL is a transient phenomenon, the atoms and
the phase of the light wave being continuously accelerated. However, it is possible
to force stationary behavior by providing additional friction for the atoms. Such
friction can be carried out by an optical molasses (see Sec. 24.2.1) characterized by
a friction coefficient γf rc . The friction force can be added to the CARL equations of
motion (22.53),

Now, the balance of forces happens at a well-defined atomic velocity, which incidentally corresponds to a well-defined CARL frequency. Assuming perfect ’bunching’
e2ıkzm = e2ıkz , and balanced forces, v̇m = 0 e α− = βe2ıkz with β̇ = 0, we obtain for

Optical molasses obviously are subject to a cooling limit coming from the random scattering of photons. As a consequence, atoms follow a random walk in the
momentum space, which leads to the diffusion and heating of atoms and impedes the
bunching of atoms. It also turns out that a minimal grouping is required to initialize CARL. Therefore, there is a threshold behavior as a function of the equilibrium
temperature of the molasses,

(23.3)

The equation corresponds to a Langevin equation, where the stochastic term ξn (t) describes white noise. We can simulate this equation by a Runge-Kutta method, where
the atoms are continually exposed to random momentum changes. For N atoms we
need to solve 2N + 2 Langevin equations to describe the dynamics of all degrees of
freedom. The Langevin equations are associated to so-called Fokker-Planck equations
[631, 524, 326, 630]. These describe the temporal evolution of the atomic density
along the optical x-axis. With these equations we replace the 2N trajectories of individual particles by a one-dimensional field P (x, t). The Vlasov equation represents a
different approach: Here we assume that the equilibrium between cooling and heating
is achieved by a continuous thermalization process described by a single rate γth 1 .
23.1.1.1

Characterization of an optical molasses

Optical molasses is discussed in Sec. 24.2.1. In Exc. 24.2.5.1 we will show how, through
a linearization of the radiative pressure force, we arrive at the following approximation,
√
F = −γf rc v
with
γf rc ' − 3~k 2 s(1 + s)−3/2 ,
(23.4)
1 Through a linearization of the CARL equations, the cavity dissipation itself is found to exert a
friction force to the atoms [279, 227]. This implies the existence of diffusion and a finite equilibrium
temperature even at if the atoms are initially at T = 0.

23.1. THE LANGEVIN MODEL

801

where s = I/Is is the saturation parameter. This formula estimates the maximum
friction force, when the lasers are tuned close to an atomic resonance 2 .
A more fundamental problem is the interdependence of the molasses friction and
the CARL. In fact, because the dipole potential influences the detuning of the molasses
beams by light-shifting the D2 line, the γth coefficient depends on ∆a and η+ (the
reverse field |α− | may be neglected). The threshold equations must then be solved
in a self consistent way. It might however be possible to determine γth only slightly
(thresh)
above threshold, where the modification is small, γth ≈ γth
.
23.1.1.2

Fluctuation-dissipation theorem

Trajectories of ensembles of particles subject to friction and stochastic forces can be
described by Langevin equations. The friction and the diffusion forces are related by
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This theorem states that, for a thermal sample
of atoms whose coordinates θn follow,
θ̈n = −γf rc θ̇n + ξn (t) ,

(23.5)

the Langevin force ξ(t) fluctuates stochastically with,
hξn (t)i = 0

and

hξn (t)ξm (t + τ )i = 2γf2rc DT δmn δ(τ ) .

(23.6)

Here, the diffusion coefficient,
DT =

γf rc

is related to the width of the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution,

σ = 2k

23.1.2

(23.7)

(23.8)

Langevin simulations

The Langevin equations of CARL can be simulated, including the random term of
the Langevin force, using the Runge-Kutta method [305]. The procedure consists in
propagating a general first order differential equation,
ẋ = f (x) + g(t) ,

(23.9)

subject to a deterministic force f and a stochastic noise g satisfying,
hg(t)i = 0

and

hg(t)g(t0 )i = 2Dδ(t − t0 )

(23.10)

2 We note that atomic species exhibiting a hyperfine structure in the ground state are subject
to cooling phenomena called ’polarization gradient cooling’, which can cause much higher friction
coefficients.
We also note that, when the molasses is applied to atoms confined to a potential, the atomic levels
can be displaced (e.g., by light-shift or the Zeeman effect). This causes an inhomogeneous effective
detuning of the laser beams generating the molasses.

23.2.2

Bistability and instability of the viscous CARL

The threshold can be found by simulating the Fokker-Planck equation while varying a
control parameter (pumping power, temperature, number of atoms) sufficiently slowly,
that the system always remains in a steady state. Fig. 23.5 shows the behavior of
the CARL, while the pump power is linearly reduced and then linearly increased at
different velocities. We observe a bistability that slightly depends on the speed of the
ramp. The behavior of the mass-center velocity kvcm and the phase of the standing
wave, φ̇, are different [523] 4 .
4 We can expect a second phase transition when the pump power exceeds a critical value, because
for N U0 > κ, the CARL becomes unstable again: It will unlock from the self-determined frequency
and start to oscillate strongly. However, this effect is not described by the equations used for the
simulation, which suppose an adiabatic elimination of the inertia.

assumption of a common steady-state velocity for all atoms obviously results in perfect

two-dimensional field in phase space. The time-evolution of this quantity is given by
the so-called Vlasov equation (or collisionless Boltzmann equation),

The final equations show that the threshold power drops as N U02 increases. To
see the dependencies of the threshold power on T and γth , we have to evaluation of
the integral (23.47). Fig. 23.6 shows a numerical evaluation of Eqs. (23.47),(23.48)

Apparently, the threshold pump power drops with vanishing friction and with
low temperatures. For typical experimental situations, T ≈ 100 µK and γth ≈ 10κ,
we expect threshold powers on the order of about P+ = 1 W, corresponding to

The Kuramoto model

Ripples on a dusty street driven by cars, rapids in a river arising spontaneously or
behind an obstacle, wind blowing over a water surface spontaneously creating waves.
Imagine a photon wind blowing over an atomic sea. Just like for water waves friction hinders boundless acceleration. The analogies are wind-molasses-friction, wateratoms, wind-acceleration-field, gravitation-dipole-force. The phenomenon is closely
related to the dissipative structure. See also (watch talk) and (watch talk).
Our system has the advantage over macroscopic systems, that the hypothesis of
uniform coupling is exactly satisfied, because the coupling medium, i.e. the light fields
are delocalized within the cavity mode. In contrast, rapids develop exclusively behind

23.3. THE KURAMOTO MODEL

811

the perturbation. There are no delay times effects and no spatial constraints due to
a finite size of the individual oscillators.
The viscous CARL system is representative for of the vast class of Kuramoto
systems [605] introduced in Sec. ??. This can be seen most appropriately by rewriting
the CARL equations in terms of phase and amplitude of individual atoms. Another
approach is via the Fokker-Planck equation, for which there already exists a Kuramoto
equivalence.
Why is it interesting to investigate yet another coupled oscillator system? Our
CARL is fully classical, although we deal with microscopic particle, such as atoms and
photons. However, our system bears the possibility of being transferred to quantum
situations, and thus to study the coupling of large ensembles of quantum oscillators.
Furthermore, the coupling mechanism is well understood and controlable by experiment. Because the coupling goes through the standing wave fraction, it depends on
the atom number and the coupling strength independently. Furthermore, the tunable
friction force (temperature) corresponds to a variable width of the distribution of the
oscillator frequencies, which we can manipulate in-situ and on-line.
Another realization of the Kuramoto model would be atoms in a ring cavity standing wave. Cold trapped atoms have the same oscillation frequencies. And thus do
not need to synchronize. For hot atoms, however, the oscillation period depends on
their kinetic energy.
The equation for the phases of the atoms is similar to the Kuramoto model [329],
θ̇n =

KX
sin(θn − θm ) − ξn (t) .
N m

(23.50)

The CARL equations which describes the dynamics of an ensemble of meanfield coupled oscillators, belong to the class of Kuramoto systems [328]. The main
differences are: a Dirac-like distribution of eigenfrequencies and a mean-field selfconsistently provided by a dynamical equation. Hence, in contrast to the original
Kuramoto model, where the collective oscillation frequency is just the mean of the
individual frequencies, the CARL frequency is self-determined and depends also on
control parameters. This phenomenon is known from other systems like rhythmic applause, which only takes place by a reduction of the individual frequencies of clapping
hands, towards a resonance. For this to happen the mean-field must self-adjust while
the individual oscillators synchronize, e.g. the noise produce by the audience must
adjust to the average desire of the audience to produce a satisfying level of noise.
In [650] is stated: ’The essence of the problem is the competition between the
intrinsic disorder (i.e. noise and diffusion) and the dynamical coupling strength. In
the Kuramoto model, the disorder enters via the distribution of natural frequencies,
while the effective coupling strength is set by the parameter combination K cos αj .’

23.3.1

Phase formalism of CARL

The starting point is the CARL equations (22.79). We make ansatz,
α+ ≡ α1

,

α− ≡ α2 eıφ

,

η + ≡ η1

,

η− ≡ η2 ei∆ ,

(23.51)

812 CHAPTER 23. STATISTICAL AND THERMODYNAMIC APPROACHES TO CARL
where the quantities with numeric suffixes are real, such that,
|α+ + α− |2 = α12 + α22 + 2α1 α2 cos φ .

(23.52)

By this ansatz we assume that a pumping laser is locked to the mode α+ of the ring
cavity, such that the phases of the fields α+ and η+ are equal and, without loss of
generality, zero. On the other hand, the phase φ of the probe mode is a dynamic
variable. Inserting the ansatz into the equations (22.79) we obtain,

23.3.2

Relationship between CARL and Kuramoto

The viscous CARL described by the formulas (23.58) corresponds to the Kuramoto
model [605]. Defining θn ≡ 2kxn as the position of the nth atom, we assume the pump
laser to be in resonance and write α+ ≡ η+ /κ [372]. The diffusion in the momentum
space is a process that limits the temperature in optical molasses.
We start from the Langevin equations (23.13). In addition, we assume that the
standing wave propagates at a constant velocity, which is to say that for a strong
viscous damping, the system quickly finds a steady state. This condition is formulated
by dt |α− | = 0 and α̇− = iωca α− with constant velocity ωca , which may be different
from the velocity of the center of mass kv. We note that this assumption can introduce
a considerable error, when used to describe temporal phase transitions, since, as shown
by simulations of the complete dynamics (23.17), the mode α− exhibits a transient
behavior, as well. We obtain from the first Eq. (23.13),

Thermodynamics of the CARL process

There is an analogy between the laser threshold and a second-order phase transition
[565], p. 341 ff : ’... The usual treatment of laser behavior is a self-consistent field theory. In the laser analysis each atom develops a radiating dipole in an electromagnetic
field due to (i.e. emitted by) all the other atoms. The radiation field produced by an
ensemble of radiating atoms is then calculated in a self-consistent fashion. (...This)
suggests the identification of the laser electric field as the variable corresponding to
the (...) order parameter and the atomic population inversion as that corresponding
to the temperature.’

816 CHAPTER 23. STATISTICAL AND THERMODYNAMIC APPROACHES TO CARL
Note that numerical simulations revealed that in certain regimes the CARL corresponds to a first-order phase transition: At high temperatures the probe to pump
power diagram shows bistability [327] and [523]DOI .
The correspondence between CARL and a common laser is illustrated by the table
below. A number of questions arise from the analogy:
The CARL being a laser without inversion, what is the equilibrium parameter? Is it

CARL as a laser

Why is CARL a laser? What is the basic difference between CARL and an AOM or
a moving Bragg mirror? CARL is essentially based on exponential self-amplification.
This self-amplification is in fact observed in our switch-off experiment [372]DOI . But
a laser is normally understood as a steady-state system. For CARL to find to a
steady-state we have to insert friction forces.
Gordon rewrites the CARL as a common laser: He generalizes the linear stability
analysis (previous Sec.) and retains the lowest-order nonlinearity. The Fokker-Planck
equations read:

Out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics

Strictly speaking the above analogy is flawed. In particular the analogy between
CARL bunching and ferromagnetic ordering is not good. While the ferromagnetic
ordering occurs as a thermodynamic phase transition, the CARL bunching is driven
by a dissipative force, which triggers spatio-temporal instabilities. Therefore viscous
CARL occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium. This may point towards an interpretation of CARL bunching as a dissipative structure along the lines traced by
Prigogine, who showed that non-equilibrium may be a source of order.
On the other hand, the laser itself is a system operating far from thermal equilibrium, since it requires a pump to emit steady-state radiation. Perhaps a comparison
with estruturas de Bénard is better than with ferromagnets. Bénard structures occur as spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry, just like CARL. One could
say that the periodicity of CARL is predefined by the pump laser wavelength, and
thus not surprising. However, the size of the periodic structures is always fixed by
boundary conditions in a more or less complicated way. For example, the size of the
Bénard structures is fixed by the viscosity, the provided amount of heat, etc., the
wavelength of surface waves can be calculated from first principles, i.e. the NavierStokes equations and the continuity equation for given boundary conditions. The
symmetry breaking resides in the exact place, where the Bénard structure develops.
It is the phase, which is broken, just like for CARL.
The Kuramoto model and the Weiss model of ferromagnetism are both mean
field theories [571]. Despite the fundamental difference that ferromagnetism is a
thermodynamic feature and Kuramoto a nonequilibrium phenomenon, they are farreaching analogies. The role of temperature in ferromagnetism is played by external
noise in Kuramoto. CARL is clearly a dissipative structure: It survives only as long
as energy is fed to the system.
23.4.2.1

Finite and infinite temperature reservoirs

The phase transition is ruled by a competition of dissipation and diffusion. If the
reservoir has zero temperature γf ric 6= 0 but D = σ 2 /γf ric = 0, i.e. we have
dissipation without diffusion. In this case, we do not expect a threshold behavior. The Lindtbladt operator for coupling to a finite-temperature reservoir is something like L ≈ κ(n̄ + 1) {...emission...} + κn̄ {...absorption...} + η {...phase noise...},
where n̄ is the mean photon number at thermal equilibrium with a given temperature
T ∝ n̄/(n̄ + 1). The interpretation in terms of dissipation without diffusion is correct
according to A. Buchleitner. There are three kinds of noises: 0 temperature noise for
n̄ → 0, ∞ temperature noise for n̄ ≈ n̄+1 and phase noise. Thus for T = 0 the energy
flux goes only from the system to the reservoir. At T > 0 entropy may go from the
reservoir to the system. The system reaches its cooling limit when the temperatures
of the system and the reservoir are balanced.
But how to explain Doppler cooling or cavity-cooling? The electromagnetic vacuum is an effective T = 0 reservoir, but the cooling is nevertheless limited by the
spontaneous decay width or the cavity linewidth, resp.. Why does coupling to a
zero-temperature reservoir not cool down to zero? Apparently, the coupling is afflicted by vacuum noise. This permits coupling of degrees of freedom having different
temperatures without reaching a temperature equilibrium. Examples are the limit of

820 CHAPTER 23. STATISTICAL AND THERMODYNAMIC APPROACHES TO CARL
cavity-cooling to the cavity decay width or simply Doppler-cooling by spontaneous
emission.
Interprete damping as scattering into continuum!

23.5

Coherent properties of CARL

In Ref. [371] we have demonstrated collective interaction of atoms with light fields
and how the application of friction via optical molasses can lead to stationary CARL
radiation at a self-determined frequency. In the papers [524, 631] we have demonstrated that the molasses also lead to diffusion resulting in a threshold behavior and
in atomic self-organization at finite temperatures. An interesting question is whether
the temperature not only determines the collective behavior, but also the deviation
from it. The temperature being related to the amount of random walk on top of the
center-of-mass motion, we may wonder whether the viscous CARL radiation bears a
signature of the atomic temperature not only in the self-determined CARL frequency,
but also in the laser emission bandwidth. It is conceivable that the autocorrelation
functions and the emission spectrum of the CARL are influenced by the fact that
the atoms experience a random walk in momentum space due to the diffusion in the
optical molasses.
In this subtext we will attempt an analytical approach, present numerical simulations and discuss how to access to the informations experimentally. The Fokker-Planck
approach described in Refs. [524, 631] is particularly well adapted to calculating collective variables. In contrast the simulation of the Langevin equation conveniently
gives access to the noise properties.

23.5.1

Analytical derivation of the coherence

Our starting point are the Langevin equations (23.13) [524, 631] in the adiabatic limit,
θ̈n = 0. The Langevin noise force is uncorrelated,

ξn∗ (t)ξm (t + τ )dτ = 2Dθ̇ δmn δ(τ ) ,

(23.91)

where the momentum diffusion coefficient Dθ̇ = γf r σ 2 is proportional to the atoms’
equilibriumptemperature, which is related to the Maxwell-Gaussian velocity spread
by σ ≡ 2k kB T /m. In contrast, the trajectories of the atoms are not, because all
atoms are motionally coupled by the fields, so that the noise imparted to one atom
is sensed by all others. Therefore the relationship (23.92) certainly does not hold for
the atomic positions,
hθn∗ (t)θm (t + τ )i  δmn δ(τ ) .
(23.92)
23.5.1.1

Single atom

So, let us first concentrate on a single atom coupled to the cavity fields. If its velocity
only fluctuates a little around a mean value ωca , we may write θ(t) ≡ ωca t+ϕ(t). The
randomized position has a Gaussian statistics leading to a Brownian motion described

23.5. COHERENT PROPERTIES OF CARL

821

by a Wiener-Levy stochastic process: hϕ(t)i = 0 and hϕ(t)ϕ(t + τ )i = Dθ (2t + τ − |τ |)
([565], p. 344),
Rθ̇ (τ ) = h[ωca + ϕ̇(t)][ωca + ϕ̇(t + τ )]i = hϕ̇(t)ϕ̇(t + τ )i = 2Dθ δ(τ ) ,

(23.93)

where Dθ = σ /γf r is the position diffusion coefficient. Note that deterministic parts
are removed from the function in order to satisfy hϕ̇(t)i = 0. In that case the spectral
density of fluctuations of the atomic phase is constant,

Note that Sθ̇ (f ) = f Sθ (f ). The variance of the fluctuations for white noise is or,

Under the assumption α̇− = iωca α− and introducing the abbreviation α0 ≡
−iU0 α+ /(κ + iωca ), the first equation (23.13) takes the form α− = α0 eiθ such that
the autocorrelation function of the field amplitude reads,

In the case of a Gaussian distribution for the noise amplitude with ϕ̇(t) = ϕ̇(−t), we
have hϕ̇2k−1 i/ (2k − 1)! = 0 and hϕ̇2k i/ (2k)! = h 21 ϕ̇2 ik /k! [151, ?, 201],

Apparently, noise mainly affects the field’s phase and not its amplitude. Note that the

The CARL emission bandwidth is thus 21 Dθ . The above results show that the CARL
laser bandwidth increases linearly with temperature and reduces with the friction
force. In our experiment we have γf r = 5κ and σ = 10κ, so that Dθ = σ 2 /γf r = 20κ.
The CARL bandwidth is extremely large as compared to the CARL frequency ωca =
5κ. The reason is that we only considered a single atom. The impact of several atoms
will partially compensate and reduce the linewidth.

Many atoms, hand-waving

In order to account for the combined effect of many atoms, we reconsider the Eq. (23.13).

The light mode α− appears to be a superposition of coherent waves having the same
frequencies, αm (t) = α0 eiωca t+iϕm (t) , but interrupted by random phase jumps. We
may thus try an analogous argumentation as for pressure broadening,

Cross-terms vanish, the autocorrelation function is just the sum of the single-atom
components. However, while we may view the noise impact of the atoms as coming
from a single atom, the rate of the phase jumps is much higher, than for a single
atom. For one atom the probability density for encountering a coherent interval of
length τ is given by p1 (τ )dτ = 21 Dθ e−Dθ |τ |/2 dτ [389]. Thus,

Fig. 23.8 shows the dependencies of the correlation functions on N and T . For
N = 106 atoms the CARL bandwidth becomes βN = 0.01κ, which is already well
below any mechanical noise. The linewidth reduction with increasing atom numbers
is quantitatively supported by numerical simulations (see below).

Schawlow-Townes limit for CARL

The ultimate limit for the spectral purity of a perfectly stable laser oscillator is the
Schawlow-Townes limit [549]. The origin of this limitation is the discrete nature of the
light field. Similarly to quantum projection noise, which is caused by the discretisation
of atomic energy levels, the optical shot-noise registered in photodetectors arises from
the discrete repartition of electromagnetic energy in photons. With a laser power P ,
a cavity bandwidth κ and an interrogation time τ , the Allan variance [?] and the
linewidth of a Schawlow-Townes limited laser are given by,

Fig. 23.9(e-f) shows spectra of the CARL frequency obtained by Fourier-transforming
the autocorrelation function of a Langevin-simulated trajectory of the CARL frequency. The width results from thermal fluctuations in the atomic motion induced
by momentum diffusion in the molasses. It is clearly visible that the width is reduced
when the atom number is increased, thus confirming Eq. (23.105).

23.5.2

Measuring the coherence properties

We may also attempt to verify the predictions in experiment. Our signals are the
beams transmitted through the cavity mirrors.
23.5.2.1

Homodyne signal

Ideally in order to get the full information on the the first-order coherence, we should
record both the in-phase and the quadrature component of the field α− = Re α− +
i Im α− by homodyning it with the local oscillator α+ . Thus we need to use both

(23.114)

(ph)

For a 50% beamsplitter the offsets disappear, Phody ∝= 2α+ Re α− , which means that
the homodyne signal is insensitive to intensity noise in the individual ports. Similarly
we obtain for the quadrature component,

By mounting a piezo on one of the mirrors in the homodyne loop, we can influence
which quadrature component to map. Is there a way how to get Im α− and Re α−
simultaneously?

Real Signals

What we record in experiment is the probe field power Pprobe and only one quadrature
component of the beat between the probe and the pump. The probe signal is simply,
P− ∝ |α− |2 .

(23.119)

So it may be used directly for the intensity correlation function (23.117) analogous to
Hanbury-Brown-Twiss.
The beat signal is obtained in a Young type experiment,
Pbeat ∝ |α+ ± α− |2 = |α+ |2 + |α− |2 ± 2α+ Re α− ,

(23.120)

because we may assume α+ real. Obviously, the beat signal oscillates between the
limits ±2α+ |α− |. Currently, we only use one port of the beamsplitter. Thus we
miss information on the other quadrature phase. The question arises now, how to
calculate the spectrum if only the real part of the field Re α is known. The interesting
quantity is |g (1) (τ )|, because it contains the information on the photon statistics.
This function is smooth (it does not oscillate) and should in our case describe an
exponential decay (23.98). Fortunately, from numerical calculation it seems that
|g (1) (τ )| is just the convolution of hRe α(t) Re α(t + τ )i/hRe2 α(t)i, so that we may
recover the informations. For the spectrum, which is calculated from the complex
quantity g (1) (τ ) the question is more delicate. It comes down to asking if,
Z
F (ω) ∝ Re
hRe α(t)Re α(t + τ )i eiωτ dτ
(23.121)
gives the correct spectrum (23.118)?
23.5.2.3

Preliminary experimental observations

Technical noise may overrule the thermal noise just like in ordinary lasers. This
situation may change if atom numbers are low, so that we have bad statistics, or if
the collective force is strong enough to correlate the noise.
The spectral width may also be limited by the finite time window t ∈ [− 21 t0 , 12 t0 ],
which is taken for computing the spectrum. Even a perfect harmonic oscillation
α− (t) = α− eiωca t will then have a finite bandwidth,

The spectrum Sα− (ω) = |Fa− (ω)|2 has a bandwidth of β = 5.6/t0 . For example
an oscillation observed for a period 100 times longer than the cavity decay time,
t0 = 100/κ, the bandwidth will be β = 0.056κ. Simulations are based on the Langevin
equation.

Manipulation of atomic gases
The field of atom optics deals with the motion of atoms and its control by technical
tools. At high velocities with no external forces, the atoms follow straight paths,
similar to light beams in classical optics. At low speeds, they propagate as waves,
similarly to wave optics in Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics. The term atom optics
emphasizes the analogy and the duality in the behavior of microscopic particles.
The duality principle is one of the fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics. The
appearance of an object as a wave or as a particle depends on the situation in which
it is observed. While the wave nature of light was well established in classical physics
since a long time, Louis de Broglie was the first in 1924 to apply the duality principle also to massive particles and to predict that particles, under certain conditions,
behave like waves whose wavelengths increase as their velocity decreases. Each particle (or sample of particles) is delocalized along a distance corresponding to the ’de
Broglie wavelength’. This feature of the matter was soon discovered experimentally in
electron beams and is still used today in commercial devices, for example in electron
microscopes.
The laser was discovered in 1956. In a laser, light particles are forced to oscillate
synchronously, that is, coherently. By analogy, we can raise the question whether
a similar phenomenon can occur with massive particles, and whether it is possible
to construct an atom laser. Such a device would emit coherent matter waves just
as the laser emits coherent light. When a gas is cooled to very low temperatures,
the Broglie waves of the atoms become very long and, if the gas is sufficiently dense,
eventually overlap. If the gas consists of a single species of bosonic particles with all
atoms being in the same quantum state, their Broglie waves interfere constructively
thus and form a huge wave of coherent matter. This matter wave is described by
a single wavefunction exhibiting long range order and having a single phase. If this
wavefunction is formed inside a trap, all atoms accumulate in its ground state. Thus,
we obtain a pure quantum state of many bodies in the kinetic degree of freedom 1 .
The transition of a gas from individual atoms to a degenerate mesoscopic many-body
quantum state occurs as a phase transition named Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
as a homage to Bose and Einstein who predicted the effect already in 1924 [85, 198].
The course begins in this chapter with a presentation of the most important experimental techniques for cooling, trapping, manipulating and detecting atomic gases.
The knowledge of these techniques will allow for a better understanding of how it is
possible to generate and analyze all the effects mentioned above. Chp. 26.9 introduces
1 In particular, for very cold atoms whose internal excitation occurs on a very different energy
scale, the corresponding degree freedom is frozen and does not influence the kinetics.

The atomic motion

24.1.1

The atom as a matter wave

We have already emphasized that atomic optics deals with the motion of atoms in a
gas, that is, we are interested only in the external degrees of freedom of the atoms.
To describe the motion of a free massive particle in one dimension, we write the

Therefore, the general solution of the stationary Schrödinger equation,

(24.2)

is,

(24.3)

Note, that the wavefunctions eıkx are not quadratically integrable. On the other
hand, they do not represent real physical systems. In practice, we need to consider
wavepackets or specify a finite volume for the particle.
Note also that the eigenvalue spectrum of is continuous. To warrant the interpretation Rof the wavefunction as a probability density we will require quadratic integrability, |ψ|2 d3 r = 1. This means that the wavefunction can not be infinite in a finite
volume, but it can be infinite in an infinitely small volume.
The description of the atomic motion by a wave equation emphasizes the fact
that microscopic particles have wave properties with each atom corresponding to a
velocity-dependent de Broglie wave,
λdB =

h
,
p

(24.4)

which describes the coherence length of the atom.
24.1.1.1

Characteristic velocities

The behavior of an atom described by the Schrödinger equation depends very much
on its kinetic energy. At high velocities (or short de Broglie waves), it will behave
like a classical particle with a well-defined trajectory. At low velocities (or long de
Broglie waves), it will propagate like a wave and exhibit phenomena such as diffraction
and interference. Therefore, it is important to highlight some characteristic velocity
regimes.
Most optical cooling techniques are based on the removal of kinetic energy upon
light scattering on electronic transitions. It is, therefore, interesting to compare the
kinetic energy (or temperature) of an ensemble of atoms with the width Γ of the
transition. The Doppler limit is given by (see Exc. 24.1.4.1),
kB TD =

~
Γ.

(24.5)

We can also compare the kinetic energy with the energy transferred to an atom by
the absorption of a single photon. The photonic recoil energy is given by,

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

Atomic clouds with temperatures around T ' TD = 10..1000 µK are called cold.
Clouds with temperatures around and below T . Trec = 0.1..10 µK are called ultracold.
In most atomic optical experiments we do not work with individual atoms (or
ions), but with relatively dilute ensembles of atoms, called clouds. In general, clouds
can not be described by a single wavefunction. Either we describe every atom by a
separate and independent wavefunction (which only works when the atoms do not
interact), or we describe the cloud by probability distributions (such as the ’density
matrix’). Let us now consider a thermal cloud. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

It represents an average over the de Broglie wavelengths of all atoms of the sample.
When a dense gas is sufficiently dense, so that this quantity exceeds the average
distance between atoms,
ρ ≡ nλ3therm > 1 ,
(24.10)
where n is the atomic density, we enter a new regime, where the Maxwell-Boltzmann
law ceases to be valid. Since λtherm ∝ T −1/2 , this regime corresponds to low temperatures. The quantity ρ is called phase space density. A phase space density approaching
1 means an increased probability of finding more than one atom per elementary phase
space cell. We then enter the regime of quantum degeneracy, where the Boltzmann

the Fermi-Dirac statistics, in the case of fermions. We will deepen the discussion of

Localized atoms

To avoid perturbative influence of the environment on the atoms, they are often
trapped in potentials, which suspend them in a volume distant from massive walls.
The Hamiltonian of a trapped atoms is,
~2 d2
+ U (x) .
(24.12)
2m dx2
As the wavefunction is now localized, the spectrum of possible energies organizes into
discrete levels, and the atoms are allocated in populations of these levels.
Often, a 3D potential can be written in the form,
Ĥ = −

U (x, y, z) = Ux (x) + Uy (y) + Uz (z) .

(24.13)

This is the case, for example, of a rectangular well characterized by Ux (x) = Uy (y) =
Uz (z) = U0 /3 inside the well. The relationship (24.13) also holds for a harmonic
potential,


U (r) =
ωx x + ωy2 y 2 + ωz2 z 2 .
(24.14)

for different combinations of Ex , Ey and Ez . That is, multidimensional systems are
often degenerate.

Density-of-states of a trapping potential

The way an atomic cloud accommodates itself inside a trapping potential is governed by the density of available states. To calculate this density, we consider the

Optical cooling

As discussed in Sec. 19.2, the force exerted by a light field on an atom can be of
two types: a dissipative force arising called radiation pressure, which is often used for
optical cooling purposes, and a conservative dipolar force which often serves for the
engineering of optical trapping potentials. Both applications of optical forces will be
detailed in the following sections.

24.2.1

Optical molasses

In the Doppler cooling model, we treat the phenomenology of optical forces quantitatively by considering the amplitude, phase and frequency of a classical field interacting
with the dipole of an atomic transition in a two-level atom. From Eq. (19.24) and
previous definitions of Ω and Ωsat , and with the intensity I ∝ E02 , we can write the
saturation parameter,

2 (2∆/Γ)2 + 1 + s

(24.24)

Now, if we consider an atom propagating in +z direction with the velocity vz counterpropagating to a light wave detuned by ∆ from the resonance, the total detuning
will be
∆ −→ ∆ + kvz .
(24.25)

840

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

where the term kvz is the Doppler shift. The force F− acting on the atom will be in
the direction opposite to the motion. In general,
F± = ±

~kΓ
s
.
2 (2(∆ ∓ kvz )/Γ)2 + 1 + s

(24.26)

Supposing now, that we have two light fields propagating in directions ±z, the total
force will be F = F+ + F− . If kvz is small compared to Γ and ∆, we find through a
Taylor expansion,
kvz (2∆/Γ)
.
(24.27)
Fz ' 4~ks
[1 + s + (2∆/Γ)2 ]2
This expression shows that, if the detuning ∆ is negative (that is, on the red side of
the resonance), then the cooling force will oppose the motion and be proportional to
the atomic velocity. Fig. 24.4 shows this restoring dissipative force as a function of
vz at a detuning ∆ = −Γ with I = Isat /2. The one-dimensional motion of the atom,
subject to a restoring force which is proportional to the atomic velocity, is that of a
damped harmonic oscillator. The proportionality factor,
αd = s

−4k 2 (2∆/Γ)
1 + s + (2∆/Γ)2

(24.28)

is just the friction coefficient.
However, the atom will not cool down indefinitely. At some point, the Doppler
cooling rate will be balanced by the heating rate coming from the momentum fluctuations of the atom absorbing and remitting photons. The Doppler cooling limit is
given by,
Γ
kB T = ~ .
(24.29)
2
This limit is generally, for alkaline atoms, on the order of dozens of micro-Kelvin. In
the early years of cooling and trapping, the Doppler limit was thought to be a real
physical barrier. But in 1988, several groups have shown that, in fact, atoms could be
cooled well below the Doppler limit. The effect arises in atoms, whose ground state
exhibits a hyperfine structure. We will show simplified one-dimensional models for
sub-Doppler cooling in the next section. Resolve the Excs. 24.2.5.1 and 24.2.5.2.

24.2.2

Sub-Doppler cooling

It turns out that atoms with a hyperfine structure in the ground state can be cooled
below the Doppler limit (24.5). To explain this unexpected observation, models involving a slow motion of the atoms in polarization gradients of a standing light wave
have been invoked. The phenomenon is now known as polarization gradient cooling.
Two principal mechanisms for cooling atoms to temperatures below the Doppler
limit are based on spatial polarization gradients. These two mechanisms, however,
invoke very different physical processes and are distinct by the spatial dependence of
the light polarization. A key point is that these sub-Doppler mechanisms only work
on atoms with multiple ground state levels. Two parameters, the friction coefficient
and the capture velocity, determine the importance of these cooling processes. In this
section we compare the expressions for these quantities in the sub-Doppler regime to
those found by the conventional one-dimensional Doppler cooling model for optical
molasses.

24.2.2.1

Lin ⊥ lin molasses

In the first case, two counterpropagating light waves with orthogonal linear polarizations form a standing wave. This configuration is familiarly called lin-perp-lin.
Fig. 24.5 illustrates the change of polarization every period of λ/8 from linear to circular to linear again, but rotated by 90◦ , and so on [149]. Along the same distance,
the light-atom coupling produces a periodic energy shift (light-shift) of the ground
state Zeeman levels. To illustrate the cooling mechanism, we assume the simplest
case, a transition Jg = 12 −→ Je = 32 . As shown in Fig. 24.5 an atom moving through
the region z ' λ/8, where the polarization is σ− , will see its population pumped
to Jg = − 12 . In addition, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients that control the dipolar
coupling of the Je = 32 require that the Jg = − 21 couples to σ− with a force three
times larger than the Jg = + 12 does. The difference of the coupling forces leads to
the light-shift between the two fundamental states shown in Fig. 24.5. As the atom
continues to move toward +z, the relative coupling forces are reversed near 3λ/8,
where the polarization is essentially σ+ . Thus, the relative energy levels of the two
hyperfine fundamental states oscillate ’out of phase’ when the atom moves through
the standing wave.
The fundamental idea is that the optical pumping rate, which always redistributes
population to the lower hyperfine level, delays the light-shift of the atom moving
through the field. The result is a ’Sisyphus effect’, where the atom spends most
of its time in sub-levels climbing a potential hill and thus converting kinetic energy
into potential energy. This accumulated potential energy is subsequently dissipated
by spontaneous emission to the electromagnetic modes of the vacuum. Simultaneously, the spontaneous emission transfers the population back to the lower one of
two ground state levels. The lower diagram of Fig. 24.5 illustrates the phase delay
of optical pumping. For this cooling mechanism to work, the optical pumping time,
which is controlled by the intensity of the light, must be sufficiently slow to give the
atom enough time to climb a noticeable part of the light-shift potential. This time
essentially depends on the speed of the atom. As the atom is moving slowly, having

Figure 24.5: The upper line shows, how the polarization changes as a function of position (in
units of a wavelength) for the ’lin-perp-lin’ standing wave configuration. The figure below
shows a simplified picture of the Sisyphus cooling mechanism for an atom with two levels,
Jg ↔ Je .

previously been cooled by the Doppler mechanism, the light field must be weak in order to decrease the optical pumping rate. Interestingly, this physical picture combines
the conservative dipole optical force, whose spatial integral gives rise to the mounts
and valleys of the potential on which the atom moves, and the irreversible dissipation
of energy by spontaneous emission, which is necessary for any type of cooling.
We can obtain simple expressions for the friction coefficient and the capture velocity after some definitions. As in the Doppler cooling model we define the friction
coefficient αlpl as the proportionality constant between the force F and the atomic
velocity v,
F = −αlpl v .
(24.30)
We assume that the light field is tuned to the red of the transition Jg - Je ,
∆ = ω − ω0 ,

(24.31)

and we denote the light-shifts of the levels Jg = ± 21 as ∆± , respectively. At the
position z = λ/8, we find ∆− = 3∆+ and at z = 3λ/8, ∆+ = 3∆− . As the applied
field is tuned to red, all ∆± have negative values. Now, for the cooling mechanism to
be efficient, the optical pumping time τp should be similar to the time needed for an
atom with velocity v to move from the bottom to the top of the potential, λ/4

At the same time, every temporal energy change of a system can always be expressed

Secondly, αlpl is independent of the intensity of the applied field. This last result is
different from the friction coefficient, which is proportional to the field intensity up

range of atomic velocities where it can operate is constrained by the condition,

The second mechanism operates with two counterpropagating light beams, which are
circularly polarized in opposite directions. When the two counterpropagating beams
have the same amplitude, the resulting polarization is always linear and orthogonal
to the propagation axis, but the tip of the polarization vector traces a helix with a
periodicity of λ [see Fig. 24.7(b)]. The physics of this sub-Doppler mechanism does
not involve hill-climbing nor spontaneous emission, but an imbalance of the photon
scattering rates by the two counterpropagating light waves as the atom moves along
the z-axis. This imbalance leads to a velocity-dependent force counteracting the
atomic displacement. The essential factor leading to the different scattering rates
is the creation of a population orientation along the z-axis between the sub-levels
of the atomic ground state. The more populated sub-levels scatter more photons.
Now, considering the energy level diagram (see Fig. 24.5) and the symmetry of the
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, it is evident that transitions Jg = 12 ↔ Je = 23 coupled
by linearly polarized light can not produce an orientation of the population in the
ground state. In fact, the simplest system exhibiting this effect is Jg = 1 ↔ Je = 2.
A measure for this orientation is the magnitude of the matrix element hJz i between
the sublevels Jgz = ±1. For an atom at rest at the position z = 0 interacting with the
light polarized along the y-direction, the light-shifts ∆0 and ∆± of the three sub-levels
of the ground state would be,
∆+1 = ∆−1 = 43 ∆0 ,

(24.44)

and the stationary populations would be 4/17, 4/17 e 9/17, respectively. Obviously,
linearly polarized light does not produce a stationary orientation, hJz is = 0. But when
the atom begins to move along the z-axis with velocity v, it sees a linear polarization

24.2. OPTICAL COOLING

precessing about the axis of propagation at an angle ϕ = kz = −kvt. This precession
gives rise to a new term in the Hamiltonian, V = kvJz . Furthermore, when we
transform to a rotating coordinate system, the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of
the atom moving in this new ’inertial’ system become linear combinations of the basis
functions of the resting atom. The expectation value of the stationary orientation
operator Jz , is now zero in the inertial system [149],

Figure 24.7: Polarization as a function of position (in units of a wavelength) for the σ + -σ −
standing wave configuration.

Note that, as the expectation value of the orientation is nonzero only when the
atom moves. In Eq. (24.45) we denote the populations of the sub-levels |± > as
Π± , and we interpret nonzero matrix elements as a direct measure of the population
difference between the ground state levels |± >. Note that, since ∆0 is negative (red
tuning), the Eq. (24.45) tells us, that the population Π− is larger than Π+ . Now, when
an atom traveling in +z direction is exposed to two light waves with polarizations
σ∓ propagating in the ∓z directions, the preponderance of population in the state
|−i will result in a higher scattering rate from the wave propagating in −z direction.
Therefore, the atom will be subject to a total force opposite to its movement and
proportional to its velocity. The differential scattering rate is,

which is a positive quantity, since ∆0 is negative for red detuning. Comparing αcp
with αlpl we see, that αcp must be much smaller, because we always assumed that
the light shifts ∆ are much larger than the linewidths Γ0 . However, the heating rate
due to fluctuations of the recoil is also much lower. Thus, the minimum temperatures
that can be reached with the two sub-Doppler mechanisms are comparable.
Although the Doppler cooling mechanism also depends on an imbalance of scattering from counterpropagating light waves, in this case the imbalance comes from
the fact that the Doppler shift experienced by the moving atoms leads to different
probabilities for photon scattering. For the sub-Doppler mechanism the scattering
probabilities from the two light waves are the same, but the ground state populations
are not. The state with the largest population suffers the highest scattering rate.

24.2.3

Raman cooling

24.2.3.1

Optical cooling of confined particles

It is also possible to cool ions confined in a trap [655]. The direction of their motion
and their velocity change periodically with the secular frequencies ζr und ζz . For
optical cooling it is sufficient to irradiate a single red-detuned running-wave light
field: In a real ion trap the cylindrical symmetry cannot be realized with absolute
precision so that we get different secular frequencies ζx 6= ζy 6= ζz and a coupling of
the degrees of freedom for all directions of space. The cooling of the ionic motion in
a single direction results in a cooling of the motion in the other directions.
In the rest system of an ion oscillating in a harmonic trap the Doppler-shift of the
laser frequency changes periodically: v(t) = v0 cos ζr,z t. The ion absorbs therefore in
its rest system the light on a withb of sidebands whose distance and strength depend
on the oscillation frequency and amplitude. The absorption profile of a transition
in such a harmonically vibrating ion follows as a convolution of the Lorentz profile
LΓ , describing the naturally broadened resonance, with a function S, describing the
splitting of the absorption profile into sidebands [318]:
X
A(∆) = (LΓ ? S)(∆)
,
S(∆) =
Jn (k · v0 /ζr,z )2 δ(∆ − nζr,z ) .
(24.49)
n

Jn denotes the Bessel function of nth order. In essence, the system is governed
by three time-constants: The natural decay width of the cooling transition Γ is a
measure for the innerratomic time scale, since it determines the average duration of
absorption-emissions cycles. The secular frequencies ζr,z determine the time scales
for changes in the external degrees of freedom, i.e. for changes of the ion’s location
and velocity. The Doppler-shift kv0 of the resonance frequency in the return point of
the ion motion finally, is a measure for the kinetic energy of the ion.
The relative importance of these three characteristic frequencies reveal the state
of the ion in the trap. The modulation index kv0 /ζr,z decides on the hight and the
number of sidebands in the excitation spectrum. The better the ion has been cooled,
the smaller the modulation index and the smaller the hight and number of sidebands.
The kinetic energy of the ion is,
Ekin =

(24.50)

24.2. OPTICAL COOLING

847

The modulation index kv0 /ζr,z = kx0 = 2πx0 /λ is also called Lamb-Dicke parameter.
By cooling the der Lamb-Dicke parameter is so much reduced and the ion is so well
localized that its motional sidebands are smaller than the wavelength of the exciting
light. It then is in the so-called Lamb-Dicke regime x0  λ [?] and has so small
motional sidebands that they do not contribute to the line shape and do not influence
the line width. Therefore the linear Doppler effect vanishes.
The quantity ζr,z /Γ defines the resolution of the sidebands. If the resolution is
poor, we talk about weak confinement, else about strong confinement. Therefore the
same ion can be weakly confined with respect to an allowed transition and strongly
confined with respect to a forbidden transition. The cooling processes in the two cases
of strong and weak trapping must be described differently. At weak confinement the
oscillation frequency ζr,z is so slow that many absorption-emission cycles with the time
constant Γ−1 can occur during one oscillation period. Cooling process and cooling
limit are approximately the same as for free particles and are described by Doppler
cooling.
24.2.3.2

Raman sideband cooling

In the case of strong confinement for the description of the cooling process we must
consider the quantization of the motional energy in the harmonic potential. The two
levels coupled by the narrow transition split into vibrational sublevels |nr,z i, which
are populated in thermal equilibrium according to the Bose-Einstein distribution and
have the kinetic energies Ekin ,
nr,z =

1
e~ζr,z /kB T

−1

and

Ekin = ~ζr,z (nr,z + 21 ) .

(24.51)

To perform the so-called optical cooling sideband cooling [655] the laser is tuned to
the first lower sideband. The laser light is then scattered in a Raman-Anti-Stokes
process at the excited electronic state with a vibrational quantumnumber lower by 1
|e, nr,z − 1i. The subsequent spontaneous decay occurs most probably to the same
vibrational substate of the ground state |g, nr,z −1i. The net effect of such a scattering
process therefore is a transition to the next lower vibrational quantum number. The
zero point energy of the ion in the trapping potential cannot be underscored by
cooling, Ekin > 21 ~ζr,z (for the Yb+ ion it is Ekin > 2 neV). However, the uncertainty
of the kinetic energy, and the temperature T given by (24.51) have no lower limit [176].
At every absorption process, free particles carry away the momentum of the photons ~k. The recoil of a free Yb+ ion corresponds to the frequency shift ε/2π =
5.3 kHz. On a narrow transition, it yields a resonance at the frequency ε. For trapped
ions, this is not the case, because the momentum is absorbed by the whole trap (see
analogy to the Mößbauer effect).
24.2.3.3

Stimulated Raman sideband cooling

We may use two lasers detuned far from resonance to couple two vibrational states.
However, additional dissipation by optical pumping is still required.
Numerous schemes have been tested to cool neutral atoms in optical lattices. For
the schemes to work, the ion should be already in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Otherwise,

848

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

transitions with transfer of higher vibrational quantum numbers nr,z are possible
during spontaneous emission. The Lamb-Dicke limit is set by kr < 1, or,

(24.52)

This means that higher trap frequencies ease the required temperature at which sideband cooling can start to work.

with respect to gravity. The upgoing beams are tuned to the blue, and the counterpropagating downgoing beams have the same detuning to the red side of the atomic
resonance (λ = 780 nm). Supposing that the resonator is close to the position of
the molasses and has with negligible length, what should be the detuning in order to
achieve 1 s time period between the two passages of the atoms through the microwave
resonator?

24.3

Optical and magneto-optical traps

24.3.1

The magneto-optical trap

An apparently fatal obstacle to the confinement of particles by optical forces is Earnshaw’s optical theorem. This theorem states that, if a force is proportional to the light
intensity, its divergence must be zero because the divergence of the Poynting vector
expressing the directional flux of intensity is zero inside a volume without sources nor
sinks of radiation. The absence of divergence precludes the possibility of a restoring
force to the interior at all places of a closed surface [19]. However, Earnshaw’s optical
theorem can be bypassed by a clever trick. The internal degrees of freedom of the
atom (i.e., its electronic energy levels) can change the proportionality between the
force and the Poynting vector in a position-dependent manner, such that the optical Earnshaw’s theorem does not apply. Spatial confinement is then possible using
the radiative pressure force generated by counterpropagating light beams. The most
common trap configuration is based on a radial magnetic field gradient produced by
a quadrupolar field and three pairs of counterpropagating circularly polarized laser
beams tuned to the red of an atomic transition and intersecting at right angles at
the point where the field is zero. This magneto-optical trap (MOT) uses the positiondependent Zeeman shift of the electronic levels as the atom moves in the radially
increasing magnetic field. The use of circularly polarized light which is red-detuned
by about Γ results in a spatially varying transition probability, whose effect is to
produce a restoring force that pulls the atom back to the origin. To understand bet-

ter how the trapping scheme works, we consider a two-level atom with a transition

(24.55)

see Fig. 24.8. We also apply counterpropagating laser beams along the directions
±z with circular polarizations of opposite signs and tuned to the red of the atomic
transition. It is clear from Fig. 24.8 that an atom moving in ±z direction will scatter
σ∓ type photons at a faster rate than σ± type photons, because the Zeeman effect
will pull the ∆mJ = ∓1 transition closer to the laser frequency. The expression for
the radiation pressure force extends Eq. (24.26) to include the Doppler effect kvz and
the Zeeman effect,
F±z = −

Γ
2 4(∆ ± kvz ± ∂ωzeem z)2 + 2Ω2 + Γ2

(24.56)

The atom will, therefore, feel a restoring force which pushes it back to the origin.
If the laser beams are red-detuned by an amount ∆ = −Γ, the Doppler shift of the
atomic motion introduces velocity-depending term to the restoring force, such that
for small displacements and velocities the total restoring force can be expressed by
the sum of a term which is linear in the velocity and a term which is linear in the
displacement,
FM OT = F1z + F2z = −αż − κz .

with r2 = x2 + y 2 and the gradient q ≡ ∂r B is
a constant, which depends only on the geometry

extension of the above results to three dimensions
is simple if we consider the fact that the gradient
of the quadrupolar field in the z-direction is twice
the gradient in the radial directions x and y, such
that κz = 2κx = 2κy .The damping term, which
proportional to the velocity, implies that the kinetic energy E is dissipated from the atom (or a
cloud of atoms) as,
E/E0 = e−2αt/m

the damping,

is typically dozens of microseconds. It is important to keep in mind that a MOT is
anisotropic, since the restoring force is proportional to the anisotropic field gradients.
Because of its dissipative non-conservative nature, it is is more accurate to characterize
a MOT by the maximum capture rate, rather than by a ’potential depth’.
In early experiments MOTs were loaded from a decelerated atomic beam. Later it
was shown, that the low-velocity tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides
a sufficient amount of atoms that can be captured by a MOT, so that it can be
loaded directly from an atomic vapor at room temperature. Now many groups in the
world use these assemblies for applications ranging from precision spectroscopy to the
optical control of reactive collisions; the MOT has become the working horse of atom
optics.
24.3.1.1

Density in a MOT

A typical MOT captures up to a billion atoms in a volume of a few 1 mm3 resulting in
densities of ∼ 1010 cm−3 . Although a MOT works as a versatile and robust ’reaction
cell’ for many applications, the frequencies of the light beams must be tuned close
to atomic transitions, which bears the disadvantage that a considerable fraction of

852

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

atoms remains in excited states. This fact is at the origin of two processes limiting the
density of a MOT: (1) losses of trapped atoms by collisions and (2) repulsive forces
between the atoms caused by reabsorption of photons scattered within the cloud.
Collisional losses arise from two sources: (i) hot atoms of the residual gas inside the
chamber can elastically collide with cold atoms and kick them out of the MOT, and
(ii) cold atoms in excited states can undergo inelastic binary collisions. ’Photoninduced repulsion’ or radiation trapping arises when a trapped atom spontaneously
emits a photon, which is then reabsorbed by other atoms. If the optical density of the
cloud is high, it can take a long time for the photon to find its way out 2 . Since any
photon exchange between two atoms will increase their relative momentum by 2~k,
this leads to a repulsive force, which is proportional to the absorption cross section
for the incident light beam. When this repulsive force balances the confining force
exerted by the MOT, any increase in the number of trapped atoms augments its size,
but its density.
24.3.1.2

Dark SPOT

In order to overcome the ’radiation trapping’ effect, the atoms can be optically
pumped into a ’dark’ hyperfine level of the ground state that does not interact with
the MOT light. In a conventional MOT one usually employs an auxiliary light beam
called ’repumper’, copropagating with the MOT beams, but tuned to another transition between hyperfine levels of the ground and excited states. The repumper recycles
the population leaking out of the (not perfectly) cyclic MOT transition. As an example, Fig. 24.10 shows the MOT and repumper transitions for sodium.
In contrast to this conventional MOT, the scheme known as the dark spontaneous
force optical trap (dark SPOT), passes the repumping beam through a glass plate the
center of which is obstructed by a small circular disk. The shadow of this disk is
projected into the center of the trap in such a way that the atoms in the center are
not repumped back into the cyclic transition, but spend most of their time (∼ 99%) in
’dark’ hyperfine levels. While the cooling and confinement force continue to operate
on the periphery of MOT, its center does not feel any radiation pressure. Dark SPOTs
are able to increase the density of a trapped cloud by almost two orders of magnitude.

24.3.2

Optical dipole traps

When temporal variations are to be applied to a confinement potential, magnetic
fields are not the best choice, because they are slow and of limited spatial resolution.
On the other side, laser beams can be varied quickly and in localized well. The dipole
force exerted by a far-detuned laser beam can be derived from the gradient of the
Rabi frequency F = −∇(d · E). Hence, it can be derived from an optical potential,
which can be used for trapping. The force may be attractive (toward the intensity
maximum) or repulsive.
Compared to MOTs, optical traps (far off-resonance optical trap, FORT) are tuned
far away from resonances, where the population in excited states is insignificant and
spontaneous forces are absent. Note from Eq. (19.21), that spontaneous forces fall off
2 E.g.

a photon at the center of the sun will take thousands of years to get out.

of photon absorption. Note from Eq. 6.2 that the spontaneous force, involving
absorption and reemission, falls off as the square of the detuning while Eq. 6.8
shows that the potential derived from dipole force falls off only as the detuning

which collisions figure importantly. We anticipate therefore that magnetic traps
intensity I = ε20 c|E|2 . This shows that the potential becomes directly proportional
to the light intensity and inversely proportional to the detuning. Therefore, at large
detuning but very high intensity, the depth of the FORT can be maintained, although
the atoms do not absorb photons. Important advantages of FORTs as compared to
MOTs are: (1) high densities (∼ 1012 cm−3 ) and (2) a well-defined polarization axis
along which the atoms can be aligned or oriented (polarization of the spins).
Since lasers beams can easily be manipulated in position, intensity, and frequency,
they can realize a large wide variety of possible geometries. For example, with a
focused laser beam, one may influence the local density of a condensate and stir it
around by moving the position of the laser beam. Strongly focussed laser beams
are often used for transporting or manipulating microscopic objects in arrangements
called optical tweezers. And with standing light waves, it is possible to form periodic
optical lattices in one, two or three dimensions (see Sec. 27.4.2).

I = 20 mW/cm2 ) be tuned in order to slow down the atoms?
c. Suppose the strontium atoms were always in resonance with the counterpropagating
laser light while being decelerated. What would be the evolution of their Doppler shift
along their trajectory (supposed to be on a straight line antiparallel to the laser beam).
d. In order to maintain the laser always in resonance we need to compensate for the
diminishing Doppler shift along the atomic trajectory. This can be done exploiting
the Zeeman shift induced by a magnetic field. We will now design a magnetic field
generating an appropriate Zeeman shift. For simplicity, let us assume 5 identical radial
solenoids distributed over L = 30 cm as sketched in Fig. 24.12, the only adjustable
parameters being the currents in all solenoids, which need to be optimized such as to
compensate the Doppler shift along the atom’s trajectory.

a. Strontium has a strong transition (Γ461 = (2π) 30.5 kHz) at 461 nm and a weak
intercombination resonance (Γ689 = (2π) 7.6 kHz) at 689 nm. A Gaussian laser
beam with the power P = 10 mW focused to a waist of w0 = 100 µm is tuned
∆689 = −(2π) 10 GHz below the intercombination transition. Calculate the potential
depth and the vibration frequencies for atoms trapped by this laser beam considering

w0 = 50 µm is subdivided into three retroreflected beams intersecting at right angles.
With this configuration we form a cubic optical lattice for strontium atoms, whose
relevant transition lies at λSr = 461 nm and has a decay width of ΓSr = (2π) 32 MHz.
Calculate the potential depth and the secular frequencies.

axial motion by quantum confinement. It can be readily shown [660] that in the far-off
resonance case and if the potential is approximate by a harmonic potential around its
minimum the eigenenergy spectrum is given by,
Epq = U0 + ~ω(q + 21 ) +

2mR02

It thus reproduces the ro-vibrational spectrum of a 2D artificial molecule and gives
rise to two normal motions. In its ground state, we have the atom optical analog
of a 2D rigid rotator. Gravity plays formally the same role as static electric fields
for molecules. Such systems might be interesting for investigating the selection rules
for transitions between ro-vibrational states involving conservation of total angular
momentum of light and atoms and yield insight into the concept of orbital angular
momentum of light fields.

For sufficiently fast periodic displacements of a far-detuned laser beam it is possible to

24.4

Magnetic traps

Purely magnetic traps are widely used in atom optics, where they served, e.g., for the
first realizations of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The most important feature
that distinguishes magnetic traps is, that they do not need light to confine atoms.
Hence, they are free of heating effects caused by photonic absorption, which turned out
to be necessary condition for reaching BEC. Magnetic traps rely on the interaction
of atomic spins with magnetic fields and gradients designed to contain the atoms.
Depending on the sign of U and F, atoms in states whose energy increases or decreases
with the magnetic field are called ’low-field seekers’ or ’high-field seekers’, respectively.
One might think, that it should be possible to trap atoms in any of these states,
generating either a magnetic field minimum or a maximum. Unfortunately, only lowfield seekers can be trapped in static magnetic fields, because in free space magnetic
fields can not form maxima. Even though low-field seekers are not in the energetically
lowest hyperfine levels, they can still be trapped because the rate of spontaneous
emission through the magnetic dipole is ∼ 10−10 s-1 , and hence completely negligible.
However, spin changing collisions can induce losses and limit the maximum densities.
Solve Exc. 24.4.6.1.
The most basic static magnetic trap for neutral atoms is generated by a pair of
current-carrying coils in anti-Helmholtz configuration (similar to the geometry used
for a MOT), producing an axially symmetric qudrupolar magnetic field. Since this
field configuration always has a central point, where the magnetic field disappears,
non-adiabatic Majorana transitions can occur when the atom passes through the
zero point. The transitions transfers population from a low-field seeking state to a
high-field seeker, which consecutively is expelled from the trap. This problem can

24.4. MAGNETIC TRAPS

859

be overcome by using a different magnetic field geometries. One example is the socalled magnetic bottle also called the Ioffe-Pritchard trap, where the minimum field
amplitude has a finite value different from zero. Other methods to eliminate the
zero-field point are time-varying potentials, such as the time-orbiting potential (TOP)
trap, or the application of an ’optical plug’, which consist in an intense dipolar optical
laser beam, tuned to the blue of an atomic transition, focused into the center of a
quadrupole trap where the magnetic field is zero, and repelling the atoms from this
area.

24.4.1

Quadrupolar traps and Majorana spin-flips

The most basic static magnetic trap for neutral atoms is generated by a pair of
current-carrying coils in anti-Helmholtz configuration producing an axially symmetric
quadrupolar magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 24.13.

Figure 24.13: (a) Quadrupolar magnetic trap generated by a pair of current-carrying wires
in anti-Helmholtz configuration. (b) Ground state energy levels of 23 Na, 2 S1/2 , F = 1 as a
function of axial distance from the trap center. (c) Illustration of Majorana spin-flips: The
red atom passes through the hole, while the green one moves adiabatically avoiding the hole.

Close to the trap center an expansion of the magnetic field generated by antiHelmholtz coils yields,



where the field gradient ∂r B along radial direction r2 ≡ x2 + y 2 in the trap center
depends on the applied current and the geometry of the coils. However, the 1:2 aspect
ratio is generic for all quadrupolar potentials, as we will see in Exc. 24.4.6.2. We easily
verify that,

24.4.1.1

Majorana spin-flips

The quadrupolar trap is the simplest one that can be technically realized. Unfortunately, this trap is not stable because of the phenomenon of Majorana spin-flips,
which expel atoms from the trapped cloud. Since this field configuration always has
a central point, where the magnetic field disappears, non-adiabatic Majorana transitions can occur when the atom passes through the zero point [see Fig. 24.13(c)]. The
disappearance of the field leaves the atoms disoriented, that is, ready to reorient their
spins. The transitions transfer population from a low-field seeking state to a high-field
seeker, which consecutively is expelled from the trap. This problem is particularly
severe for hydrogen, where it can induce a so-called relaxation explosion [299].

Magnetic Ioffe-type traps

The spin-flip problem can be overcome by using a different magnetic field geometries. One example is the so-called magnetic bottle, also called the Ioffe-Pritchard
trap illustrated in Fig. 24.14(a), where the minimum field amplitude has a finite value
different from zero. Other methods to eliminate the zero-field point are time-varying
potentials, such as the time-orbiting potential (TOP) trap illustrated in Fig. 24.14(b)
and discussed in Exc. 24.4.6.4 [203, 273], or the application of an ’optical plug’, which
consist in an intense dipolar optical laser beam, tuned to the blue of an atomic transition, focused into the center of a quadrupole trap where the magnetic field is zero, and
repelling the atoms from this area (see Fig. 24.22). The advantage of Ioffe-Pritchardtype traps is that they are always harmonic sufficiently close to the trap center, which
simplifies the theoretical treatment in many respects, as shown in Exc. 24.4.6.5.

Radiative coupling and evaporative cooling

As we saw in the last section, optical cooling becomes ineffective when the density of
the gas is high. Hence, we need another dissipation mechanism to cool trapped atoms.
A method called evaporation has been proposed by Hess [297] for spin-polarized hydrogen (H↑) and was observed by Masuhara et al. [408]. Later, evaporation was used
on alkali metals [2, 487, 154]. A detailed review of the subject was published by
Ketterle and van Druten [348].
Another collision-based cooling mechanism is sympathetic cooling. The technique
was originally used in ion traps. Later it was applied to neutral atoms confined in
magnetic traps. The idea is to get the cloud under study into thermal contact with a
cold buffer gas. In some cases, the buffer gas may be optically or evaporatively cooled.

864

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

Figure 24.16: The basic idea of evaporation consists in removing hot particles from the
sample.

Sympathetic cooling has been used in magnetic traps to create double condensates
[458] and to cool fermions until the regime of quantum degeneracy [162].

24.4.4

Evaporative cooling

Evaporation always occurs when energetic particles abandon a system with finite
bonding energy, removing more than their share of average energy per particle. Here,
we consider the case of a finite-sized trapping potential, that is, the potential has an
edge or a beak through which hot atoms, with sufficient kinetic energy to reach that
region, may leave the trap. In the ideal case, this will lead to a complete truncation
of the hot tail of the equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. If the
remaining system finds back to thermal equilibrium, it will do at a lower temperature.
The redistribution of kinetic energy between atoms leading to thermalization occurs
through elastic collisions.

now use the new values for N and T to calculate the new equilibrium Boltzmann
distribution starting all over from Eq. (24.105),

Repeating this over and over the temperature will gradually reduce. The cooling
process can be speed up by readjusting the truncation frequency to the actual temperature. This is called forced evaporation (see Fig. 24.18).

24.4.4.2

Rethermalization

As already mentioned, rethermalization occurs due to elastic collisions. It needs more
or less three collisions per atom to rethermalize a cloud [442, 665], so that the collision
rate determines the speed of the evaporation process. A large collision rate is desirable
to keep the evaporation process faster than trap loss processes. Evaporation ramps
between several seconds and a minute are typical.
The maximum rate of elastic collisions between trapped atoms (in the trap center)
is,
√
γcoll = n0 σel v̄ 2 ∝ ρ3 N 2/3 ,
(24.112)
where n0 is the peak density,

σel = 8πa2s ,

(24.113)

is the cross-section
for elastic collisions and, v̄ being the average thermal velocity of
√
the cloud, 2v̄ is the average relative velocity between two of its atoms [347]. This
formula gives the average collision rate at the center of the cloud, where the density
is highest. To calculate the total collision rate, we need to integrate over the entire
volume of the cloud,

For harmonic potential we find an average rate reduced by 2 2, for linear potentials
by 8. We verify this in Exc. 24.4.6.7. Finally, the rate for collision events is two times
smaller, as it involves two atoms at a time.
Obviously, the evaporation process slows down when the cloud cools more, unless
the edge of the potential is lowered, such that the hotter atoms of the colder cloud can
be evaporated. By continually lowering the edge of the potential, while the atomic
cloud keeps on rethermalizing (this procedure is called forced evaporation) very low
temperatures in the nano-Kelvin regime can be achieved, and the phase space density
can be increased by many orders of magnitude (between a MOT and a BEC there are
6 orders of magnitude) up to the threshold of Bose-Einstein condensation. Of course,

24.4. MAGNETIC TRAPS

867

this is only possible by sacrificing many hot atoms. Even with a well optimized
evaporation ramp (i.e., a controlled lowering of the potential edge), usually only some
0.1% of the atoms reach the condensation phase after about 500 collisions per atom.
Two aspects should be mentioned regarding the optimization of the evaporation
ramp. The first aspect is, that elastic collisions with atoms from the residual background vapor of the vacuum chamber limit the lifetime of the trap. Therefore, the
evaporation must be sufficiently fast, which requires either a high rate of elastic collisions or a good vacuum. A compromise must be found between a slow but efficient
evaporative cooling and a minimization of the losses, which come into play when the
evaporation takes too long. The second aspect is, that the dimensionality of the evaporation surface determines the effectiveness of the cooling. In the first demonstration
of evaporation, H↑ atoms of a hot cloud were ejected over a saddle point. The saddle
was located a small region away from the trap center, and only atoms with sufficient
kinetic energy along a certain direction, Ez > Uedge , could leave the trap. In such
cases, evaporation is called one-dimensional. Even though ergodic redistribution due
to anharmonicities of the potential will drive, sooner or later, all the atoms to this
region, this effect becomes less pronounced when the cloud cools down, because the
atoms accumulate at the bottom of the approximately harmonic (and therefore separable) potential. This fact has inhibited efficient evaporation of H↑ below 120 µK
[220].
A second evaporative technique has been demonstrated in traps called timeorbiting potential (TOP) [487]. It is a feature of TOP traps to display a spatial
region called a ’death-circle’, where passing atoms are ejected from the trap. This
fatal circle can act as a 2-dimensional evaporation surface, provided the radius of the
circle is large enough [273]. However, under the influence of gravity the dimensionality
is further reduced to 1D [347].
The most successful evaporation technique implemented so far is based on a radiative coupling of confined and free states. We discuss this technique in the following
sections. Publications on evaporative cooling are [391, 428, 487, 504, 55, 423, 442, 204,
207, 286, 463, 297, 408, 154, 348, 664, 274, 403, 188, 299]. See ([134], Sec. 3.1.4) for

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES
Radiative coupling of internal state

The most successful evaporation technique implemented so far is based on a radiative coupling of confined and free states. We discuss this technique in the following
sections. See ([134], Sec. 3.1.4) for an overview.
The radiative coupling technique originates
from an idea proposed by Pritchard et al. [274],
who have already had some experience with radiofrequency spectroscopy in magnetically trapped
neutral atoms [403, 286]. The spatial dependence
of the Zeeman splitting is an intrinsic feature of
magnetic traps. Irradiation of a radio wave at a
certain frequency couples trapped and untrapped
Zeeman substates at a well-defined distance from
the trap center. This gives rise to a 3D evaporation surface, where the passing atoms can undergo Figure 24.19: Illustration of evapLandau-Zener transitions and be expelled from the orative truncation.
trap. The technical advantages of this technique
are substantial: The magnetic trapping potential does not have to be manipulated,
for example, by the creation of a nozzle, and the potential edges can be easily controlled by the radiofrequency. If evaporation is forced via a continuous reduction
of the radiofrequency and if the evaporation ramp is optimized, the density will increase as well as the collision rate. Rethermalization will accelerate and initiate a
self-accelerated evaporation process (run-away evaporation). Rf-evaporation was first
demonstrated by Ketterle and colleagues [154]. Solve Exc. 24.4.6.9.
24.4.4.5

Adiabatic and diabatic limits of rf-induced evaporation

Rf-induced evaporation can be described within the formalism of the dressed atom
[124], where the different states mF of an atom with spin F are coupled to an rf-field 6 ,
which we assume to be linearly polarized:
B(t) = Bêrf cos ωt .

(24.117)

The element of the coupling matrix between the levels, |F, mF i and |F, mF ± 1i is,
p
µB g
Ω=
|Brf × êB | F (F + 1) − mF (mF + 1) ,
(24.118)
4~

where g is the atomic g-factor and êB the orientation of the local static magnetic
field.
The adiabatic potentials U (r) are obtained through the eigenvalues of the atomic
states dressed by the local magnetic field B(r). In the dressed atom picture, we
consider the total energy of the atom plus the field of N radiofrequency photons.
Without coupling, this simply means that N ~ω is added to the atomic Zeeman energies, resulting in a Zeeman pattern being vertically shifted by N ~ω for N = 0, ±1, ...
At positions where the rf-field is in resonance, curves with ∆N = 1 intersect. Here,
the coupling develops an avoided crossing, which determines the pattern of adiabatic
energy levels [see Fig. 24.20(b)].
6 Alternatively,

a microwave frequency may be used to couple different hyperfine levels.

state with F = 1. (Right) Adiabatic potentials resulting from the coupling of Zeeman
levels via radiofrequency radiation being resonant with the difference of Zeeman levels at the
position 0.7.

A slowly moving atom remains on the curve of an adiabatic potential. As an
example, let us assume an atom in the hyperfine state |F, F i moving away from the
center of the trap. When it comes close to resonance, the rf-field blends this state
with other mF -states, from the |F, F − 1i down to the |F, −F i state, which changes
the slope of the potential curve. Beyond the resonance point, the atomic state is
adiabatically transformed into an untrapped high-field seeking state, and the atom
is repelled from the trap. Thus, while passing the avoided crossing, the atom has
emitted 2F rf-photons in a stimulated manner and inverted the orientation of both
the electron and the nuclear spin.
In this way the radiofrequency generates an adiabatic potential surface with a
depth of approximately |mF |~(ω − ω0 ), where ω0 is the resonant rf-frequency at the
center of the trap. The evaporation process corresponds, then, to the removal of the
most energetic atoms out of the trap.
For this adiabatic picture to be valid, an adiabaticity condition must be fulfilled.
This condition requires that the energy difference at the avoided crossover be larger
than the energy uncertainty related to the limited time that an atom with velocity v
spends in the resonance region. For a two-level system coupled by a matrix element
V12 and an atom moving with velocity v along the z-axis, the transition probability
P between the adiabatic curves is given by the Landau-Zener formula [529],
P = 1 − e−ξ

with

ξ=

2π|V12 |2
.
~gµB ∂z Bv

(24.119)

The Landau-Zener theory is strictly valid only for a two-level system, which we use
here only for a qualitative discussion of two following limiting cases.
For a weak rf-field, ξ  1, P is much smaller than 1, i.e., the atoms remain predominantly on the diabatic surface shown in Fig. 24.20(a). The probability for a spin
flip transition is, P ≈ t, which describes the diabatic limit of rf-induced evaporative cooling: The atomic energy levels are almost unperturbed, the atoms often spill
across the resonance surface, and only after 1/P oscillations, they spin-flip from the
hyperfine state |F, F i to the |F, F − 1i.

870

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

The adiabatic limit is clearly the ideal situation for evaporative cooling. However,
the evaporation process in a trap (with oscillation time Tosc ) saturates at a lower
rf-power. The condition for saturation is P ≈ Tosc /τel , where τel is the average time
between two collisions. This means that an energetic atom is evaporated before it
collides again.
Only the component of the magnetic field of the rf-radiation which is perpendicular to the magnetic trapping field induces spin-flips. In certain geometries of the
confinement potential, for example the quadrupole trap, the magnetic field covers the
entire solid angle. Consequently, there are two points where the trapping field and
the rf-field are parallel and the elements of the transition matrix consequently zero.
Within an area around these points, the coupling is diabatic. In practice however, the
rf-transition can be sufficiently saturated that this area is small and does not strongly
affect the evaporation efficiency.
Note also that gravitation deforms the equipotential surfaces of the confinement
potential, which can reduce the evaporation efficiency [347]. Solve Exc. 24.4.6.10.

24.4.5

Sympathetic cooling

The efficiency of evaporative cooling depends on the rate of interatomic collisions.
However, there are atomic species with unfavorable, that is, small or even negative scattering lengths. Also, while at low temperatures only s-wave collisions occur
(higher partial waves being frozen behind the centrifugal barrier), such collisions are
prohibited for fermionic gases. Fermions or species with unfavorable scattering lengths

24.4. MAGNETIC TRAPS

871

can not be cooled by evaporation. There is, however, another technique called sympathetic cooling by thermal contact with another species. The additional species is, in
general, actively cooled (e.g., by evaporation), while the species of interest is passively
cooled via elastic collisions with atoms of the additional species. Of course, for this
scheme to work the interspecies scattering length and the mass ratio must be adequate
to ensure adequate thermal coupling.
Following [456] the transfer of kinetic energy between two colliding atoms is reduced by a factor depending on the their mass difference,
ξ=

(24.120)

Around 3/ξ collisions per atom on average are required for complete thermalization
of a gas. For example, for the Rb-Li mixture, we have 3/ξ = 12.4. The collision rate
is,

Other traps

24.5.1

Ion traps

The electric charge of ions allow for their efficient manipulation and control by electric and magnetic fields exploiting the Coulomb-Lorentz force. In fact, the control
is so good, that it is possible to isolate and store individual ions or even arrays of
quantum entangled ions and to perform coherent operations on them, which qualifies them as quantum registers. Two different types of traps have been investigated.
In Penning traps [484], electrically charged particles are subjected to a radially attractive quadrupolar electrostatic field superimposed to an axial magnetostatic field
forcing the particles into closed circular orbitals 7 . In the so-called radiofrequency
trap or Paul trap –Wolfgang Paul received the Nobel Prize in 1989 together with
Hans Dehmelt and Norman Ramsey– charged particles subjected to an alternating
electric field with quadrupolar symmetry. Hyperboloidal electrode configurations produce saddle-shaped potentials, as shown in Fig. 24.24, which are, at any instant of
time, parabolically repulsive in the one direction (axial or radial) and parabolically
attractive in the other (radial or axial). The alternating electric field causes a periodic reorientation of the Coulomb force, which leads to a time-averaged parabolic
quasi-potential Φ(r, t). In this potential the particles perform harmonic oscillations
at characteristic frequencies, which are independent of the oscillation amplitude [480]:
Φ(r, z) = Φ0 (t)(r2 − 2z 2 )

,

r 2 = x2 + y 2 ,

(24.125)

7 Note that purely electrostatic fields do not lend themselves to trapping, since the necessary
condition for the existence of minima in a potential, ∂i ∂j φ < 0, does not obey the Laplace equation.

Φdc denotes the amplitude of the dc part of the voltage, Φac the amplitude of the ac
part. The potential Φ(r, z, t) exerts, in the temporal average, a central force on the
ion, if the radiofrequency field satisfies specific conditions.

24.5.1.1

Evaluation of the stability diagram

Paul traps do not have to have perfect quadrupolar geometry. To determine the
secular frequencies of the pseudo-potential for an arbitrary geometry, we expand the
potential around the position r0 of the potential minimum, which depends on the
geometry of the electrodes and the applied voltages,

In the last step, we assume that the potential has an almost cylindrical shape. For
a given geometry, the curvatures bz,r can be extracted from numerical simulations.
From the continuity equation, we find bz = −2br . The polarity of the electrodes is
modulated with frequency Ω,
Φ(r, t) = Φ(r)(ζ − cos Ωt) .

(24.128)

The equations of motion are derived from mr̈ = −e∇φ(r, t),

(24.131)

These equations predict stable orbits, provided that the parameters a and q are within
the so-called stability diagram shown in Fig. 24.25.

In the limit |ai |, qi  1 the ion travels only a short distance s  r0 during one

modulated by a rapid oscillation called micromotion, which is excited by the modulation field Ωa . Without dc voltage applied between the ring and the endcaps, ai = 0,
the motion of the ion is described by the following simple equation:

The motion of an ion in a Paul trap is a superposition of two vibrations with the
respective oscillation frequencies Ωa (modulation frequency) and ζr,z (secular frequencies for radial and axial direction vibrations). For an ion in thermal equilibrium
(i.e., without active cooling), the mean kinetic energies of the micro- and macromotion
are equal [67].
The macromotion can be reduced by cooling, in contrast to the micromotion,
which is constantly excited by the modulation of the applied electric field [119]. On
the other hand, the amplitude of the micromotion decreases with the distance of the
ion from the trap center and, in the minimum of the pseudo potential, disappears
completely. Therefore, to suppress the micromotion, it is imperative to cool the
macromotion and push the ion to the trap center, if necessary, using additional static
electric fields. Since the frequency of the micromotion is much higher than that of the
macromotion, the dynamic sidebands can be resolved on a sufficiently narrow optical
transition. When the modulation frequency Ωa is very high, the secular frequencies
of the macromotion are also high, so that even large optical transitions are able to
resolve the macromotional sidebands. This is called the strong coupling regime.
Because of Coulomb repulsion, only a single atom can be at the center of a Paul
trap, such that it is difficult to zero micromovement. One solution is to use a linear
trap, where the center is smeared out over a straight line. Solve Exc. 24.5.4.1.

24.5.2.1

Electronic detection of ions

The presence of ions in the trap can be probed through the damping that they induce
a coupled electronic resonance circuit [639, 643].

24.5.3

QUEST

Homonuclear atoms and dimers do not have a permanent electrical dipole moment,
but they may have a permanent magnetic dipole moment. Therefore, homonuclear
dimers must be confined by magnetic field gradients, or else an electric dipole moment
must be induced by an oscillating electromagnetic field. In the optical regime, this
was demonstrated with the quasi-electrostatic trap (QUEST).
In contrast, heteronuclear dimers are polar molecules with a permanent electric
dipole moment, which can be quite large if the molecules are deeply bound. According
to Earnshaw’s theorem, there is no static magnetic field maximum in free space. Thus,
no ’high-field seeking’ state can be trapped. In principle, QUEST-type dipolar optical

radiofrequency, while a DC voltage is scanned across the stability diagram. Simultaneously,
an oscillating field is tuned near one of the trap’s secular frequencies. When the stability
point is such, that the secular frequency coincides with the frequency of the oscillating field,
the motion of the ions is parametrically excited and the resonance circuit is damped. This
damping is detected by a narrow-band amplifier.

traps can also be used for heteronuclear dimers. The problem is, however, that in
contrast to homonuclear molecules, transitions between the vibrational ground state
levels are possible. Thus, the light generating the QUEST also induces transitions
leading to a redistribution of the population over all vibrational states.

Loosely bound homonuclear molecules are subject to the sum of the restoring forces
exerted by magnetic traps on the individual atoms, µm = 2µa and dm = 2da . This is
also true for heteronuclear molecules as long as the trapping potential is much weaker
than the binding energy.

Analysing techniques

To analyze the kinetic state of an atomic gas and, for example, to identify the presence
of a Bose-Einstein condensate, it is necessary to measure its spatial or momentum
distributions. However, the only way to gather information from the atoms is to throw
some kind of particles into them and to detect, where these particles are scattered.
The most suitable particle to penetrate an ultra-high vacuum chamber surely is the
photon. Therefore, apart from few exceptions where electron beams are used, all
information on ultra-cold gases has been obtained so far through their reactions to
incident laser beams [304, 108, 14, 330, 245].

24.6.1

Time-of-flight imaging

The most common imaging techniques measure the absorption of a laser beam by an
atomic cloud after a time-of-flight or the dispersion of a laser beam induced by trapped
cloud. The amplitude E0 of a light wave traversing an atomic cloud of diameter L
and characterized by the refractive index η is modified by a factor eiωLη/c . For an
inhomogeneous cloud, we have,

Now, the absorption and dispersion coefficients can be related to the optical crosssection σ(∆) defined in (1.102) [389], where ∆ is the detuning of light frequency from
an atomic resonance, whose linewidth is Γ. This result is called the optical theorem,

The absorption b describes the loss of intensity for the laser beam due to scattering
by the (disordered) atoms. It is strong near resonance, but diminished quadratically
with the detuning ∆. The scattering is necessarily accompanied by radiation pressure
accelerating and heating the atoms. The dispersion ϕ describes the refraction of the
laser beam by the atomic density distribution (which for this purpose can be considered as continuous) [135, 217]. It disappears in resonance and diminishes slowly with
increased detuning (∝ ∆). It is connected to the dipole force and, thus, does not heat
the atomic cloud. The coefficient ϕ describes the phase shift of the electromagnetic
wave transmitted through the atomic cloud.

Figure 24.30: Sequence of a typical time-of-flight experiment: As soon as the trapping
potential is suddenly switched off, the atomic cloud ballistically expands for 18 ms, before
it is illuminated by a short resonant laser pulse. The shadow printed by the cloud onto the
beam is photographed by a CCD camera.

24.6.2

Absorption imaging

Let us now detail the experimental process of absorption imaging (see Fig. 24.31):
The trap confining the atomic cloud is suddenly turned off, thus letting the atoms,

882

CHAPTER 24. MANIPULATION OF ATOMIC GASES

accelerated by the Earth’s gravitation, fall for a flight time of a few ms. Then a pulse
of a resonant laser light, whose diameter is much larger than the size of the cloud,
is irradiated. The local attenuation of the beam intensity I ∼ |E|2 can be related
through the absorption b (also called optical density or optical depth) to the atomic
density via,
Z
I(x, y)
− ln
= b(x, y) = σ(∆) n(r)dz .
(24.141)
I0

The shadow printed by the atomic cloud on the transverse profile of the laser beam
is recorded by a CCD camera.
We have already noted that the absorption is accompanied by radiative pressure.
After some scattering events, due to the photonic recoil, the atoms have accumulated
a sufficiently large velocity, and therefore a sufficiently large Doppler shift, to be
out of resonance with the laser beam. Subsequent photons are no longer scattered
by the atoms and only contribute to increase the illumination of the CCD camera
without carrying any information about the presence of atoms. Consequently, it is
advantageous to use very short laser pulses. In addition, the intensity of the laser beam
should not saturate the transition in order to guarantee an optical cross-section, which
is independent of the intensity, and hence to guarantee the validity of the LambertBeer law. Finally, the laser frequency must be tuned perfectly to resonance, ∆ = 0.
Otherwise, the interaction between the laser beam and the atomic cloud becomes
partially dispersive, which leads to a focusing or defocusing of the laser beam by
refraction and a distortion of the image making it impossible to estimate the size of
the cloud.
Fig. 24.31 shows examples of absorption images of an atomic cloud taken at different stages of the evaporation process. Fig. 24.31(a,b) was taken at a temperature of
320 nK; the cloud is large and isotropic and therefore purely thermal. At 250 nK [see
Fig. 24.31(c,d)] an elliptically shaped part appears in the center of the thermal cloud.
And at 180 nK [see Fig. 24.31(e,f)] the thermal cloud almost completely disappeared
for the benefit of the condensate. A quantitative evaluation of the condensed fraction
is given in Sec. 25.1.4. Solve the Excs. 24.6.6.2 and 24.6.6.1.

24.6.3

Dispersive imaging

The absorption imaging technique is destructive, because of the involved ballistic expansion and also because of the radiative pressure exerted by the resonant imaging
beam, which accelerates and heats the atomic cloud. That is, the measurement process messes up the distributions of the cloud, such that a second image taken after
the first one will give different results. However, there is a non-destructive imaging
technique called dispersive imaging or phase contrast imaging. In this technique, the
laser light is tuned sufficiently far from resonance, |∆|  Γ, for spontaneous emission
and heating induced by random photonic recoil to be negligible [14]. This permits to
take a series of consecutive images and create a movie of the temporal evolution of
the cloud. Another advantage of this technique is the low off-resonant optical density, which allows to take pictures of very dense clouds in situ, that is, while they are
confined in a trap.
The physical quantity which is measured by this method is the local phase shift of
the wavefront of the probe laser. Wavefront distortions are difficult to measure. To

transform the phase profile into an intensity profile, a method known from classical
optics called Schlieren method is used. It is based on the interference of the probe
beam with its distorted wavefront and a reference plane wave. In practice, there
are several possibilities. For dark-ground imaging, the part of the incident beam
not having interacted with the atoms is blocked behind the interaction zone (see

The intensity I¯pc is linear in b and, consequently, more sensitive to weak signals.
Finally, a third technique, called polarization contrast imaging, detects the local birefringence of the atomic cloud [89, 534].
The imaging techniques shown so far only allow to visualize the instantaneous
density distribution of the atomic cloud n(r). If we are interested in other quantities,
we have to conceive the experiment in such a way, that the desired information leaves
its signatures in the density distribution. For example, to measure the excitation
frequencies of a condensate, which can perturb its shape and observe the subsequent
time evolution of n(r, t) via dispersive imaging [333, 424, 15, 349].

Thermodynamics of ideal
quantum gases
The journey of the quest for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) begins with its prediction by Bose and Einstein in 1926. The first hint, that the condensation was more
than just a theoretical fantasy came from London [388], who linked the newly discovered phenomenon of superfluidity in 4 He to BEC. However, the interpretation of
the λ-point in terms of BEC was not obvious, because strong interactions between
particles concealed the role of quantum statistics, and the thermodynamic potentials
exhibited divergences at the critical temperature instead of discontinuities, as expected for an ideal gas BEC. These uncertainties triggered an intense search for other
systems. In 1954, Schafroth pointed out that electron pairs can be seen as composite
bosons and may form Bose-Einstein condensates at low temperatures [548]. In 1957,
Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer developed the microscopic theory of superconductivity [41], after other researchers, including Blutt, Schaffrot, Fröhlich and Bogolubov,
had suggested a relationship of this phenomenon to Bose condensation of electron
pairs (nowadays called Cooper pairs).

CHAPTER 25. THERMODYNAMICS OF IDEAL QUANTUM GASES

in weakly interacting systems, in 1962 Blatt et al. proposed the investigation of the
BEC in gases of excitons [66]. Excitons are bound electron-hole pairs that can form a
weakly interacting gas in certain non-metallic crystals. They are interesting because
their small mass allows BEC at high temperatures and gas density can be controlled
over a wide range, by only modifying the intensity of the optical excitation. Being
quasi-particles, excitons can be created and annihilated, that is their number is not
conserved. Excitons were discovered in 1968, and the first evidence for Bose-Einstein
of biexciton molecules in a CuCl crystal dates back to 1979 [111].
The laser as coherence phenomenon between photons shares many analogies with
condensates. However, photons are quasi-particles as well, and again their number
is not conserved 1 . Hence, there is no phase transition: When an optical cavity
containing photonic modes is cooled, the photons prefer to disappear in the walls of
the cavity instead of condensing.
Hecht [281] suggested in 1959, followed by Stwalley and Nosanow [606] in 1976,
that an atomic hydrogen gas with polarized spins would be an appropriate candidate
for BEC. The advantage of this system is that interactions between atoms are weak
and only give rise to a negligible quantum depletion below 1%. In 1978 Greytak and
Kleppner started at the MIT intensive efforts to generate BECs in dilute hydrogen
gases. In the 1990s, important advances in the cooling of atoms using laser light
allowed to reach very low temperatures, and the invention of the magneto-optical trap
(MOT) for neutral atoms permitted their spatial confinement and the compression of
their density. These successes boosted efforts to try to create BEC in alkaline gases,
which have electronic level schemes that lend themselves to optical cooling. Later, it
was discovered that the phase space density in MOTs is limited by radiation trapping
effects. As a solution to this problem, scientists had to learn how to trap atoms
without the use of light in conservative traps, e.g. by their magnetic dipole moment,
and to replace optical cooling with evaporative cooling. This was the crucial step
that finally permitted to reach BEC in alkaline gases in 1995. Later, the hydrogen

of their success, has been taken to BEC as well [220].
Why did it take so long to reach Bose-Einstein condensation, seven decades after
its prediction by Bose and Einstein? How can we see when we have a condensate?

Quantum statistics of an ideal Bose gas

The canonical approach to statistical mechanics begins with the probabilistic analysis
of Boltzmann’s velocity distribution of an ideal gas. For a gas consisting of particles
of mass m at temperature T , the velocity distribution is given by the well-known
Maxwell-Boltzmann law (MB) [307]
g(v) =

r

m
2πkB T

3

/2kB T

,

(25.1)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Maxwell-Boltzmann’s law was experimentally
proven by Otto Stern in 1920, using a primitive atomic beam and a simple timeof-flight technique based on a rotating drum for selecting atomic velocities. With
the advent of laser spectroscopy, the MB law and its limitations can be tested with
highly improved accuracy. This law describes well the behavior of weakly interacting
hot atoms. Deviations from this law are insignificant until, at low temperatures,
quantum effects come into play. For this to happen the temperature must be so
low that the atomic Broglie wavelengths become comparable to the average distance
between particles. For a gas in thermal equilibrium the characteristic wavelength,
called thermal de Broglie wavelength, is,

λtherm =

s

2π~2
,
mkB T

(25.2)

where ~ = h/2π is Planck’s constant. In a gas of density n, the mean distance between
particles is n−1/3 . So, quantum effects are expected to emerge when n−1/3 ∼ λdB (T ),
such that the limit for this regime is defined by,
kB T (n) =

2π~2 2/3
n
.
m

(25.3)

For example, an atomic gas with density n ∼ 1016 cm−3 and temperature 900 K is
certainly in the classical regime, since n−1/3 ∼ 106 cm  λdB = 10−9 cm. To observe
quantum effects, we need relatively dense and cold clouds of atoms. In most gases,
lowering the temperature or increasing the density promotes the system to liquidity
before the quantum regime is reached. Well-known exceptions are spin-polarized
hydrogen (H↑), which does not become liquid and helium, which exhibits quantum
degeneracy effects in the liquid phase, although these effects are quite complex due
to strong interparticle forces.
We have already seen that all particles in the quantum world are either bosons with
integer spin or fermions with semi-integer spin. Fermions do not share a quantum
state, because they must follow the Pauli’s exclusion principle. They obey a quantum
statistical distribution called Fermi-Dirac distribution (FD). In contrast, bosons enjoy
to share a quantum state and even encourage other bosons to join them in a process
called bosonic stimulation. Bosons obey a quantum statistical distribution called
Bose-Einstein distribution (BE). The basic difference between the MB-statistics on
one hand and the BE- or FD-quantum statistics on the other is that the former applies
to identical particles which, however, are distinguishable from each other, while the

892

second describes identical indistinguishable particles. For the BE/FD statistics one
can derive [?] the occupancy number for a non-degenerate quantum state having the
energy ε when the system is kept at temperature T ,

where we used the abbreviation β ≡ 1/kB T . The upper sign refers to the BE statistics,
the lower sign to the FD statistics. The chemical potential µ is an important system
parameter, which helps to normalize the distribution (25.4) to the total number of
particles,

Similarly, the total energy of the system is given by,

A very remarkable effect occurs in a bosonic gas at a certain characteristic critical
temperature Tc : below this temperature a substantial fraction of the total number
of particles occupies the lowest energy state, while all other states are occupied by
a negligible number of particles. Above the transition temperature the macroscopic
observables of the gas, such as pressure, heat capacity, etc., receive contributions of all
states with a certain statistical weight, but without favoring the state of lower energy.
Below the transition temperature, the observables are altered by a macroscopic occupation of the ground state, which results in dramatic changes of the thermodynamic
properties. The phase transition is named after Shandrasekar Bose [85] and Albert
Einstein [198] Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC).

25.1.1

Condensation of a free gas confined in a box potential

One of the keys to understanding BEC is the behavior of the chemical potential µ at
very low temperatures. The chemical potential is responsible for the concentration of
a large number of atoms in the ground state N0 . A system with a large number of noninteracting bosons condenses to the ground state when the temperature approaches
zero, N0 → N . The Bose-Einstein distribution function (25.4) gives the population
of the ground state, ε = 0, in the zero temperature limit, N = limT →0 (e−βµ − 1)−1 =
−1/βµ, or in terms of the fugacity defined by,
Z ≡ eβµ ,

(25.7)

we may write, Z ' 1−1/N . It should be noted that the chemical potential in a bosonic
system must always be less than the ground state energy in order to guarantee nonnegative occupation wT,µ (ε) of any state. Z ' 1 denotes macroscopic occupation of
the ground state. We define the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation
via the occupation of the ground state. Above this temperature the occupancy of
ground state is not macroscopic, below it is.

25.1. QUANTUM STATISTICS OF AN IDEAL BOSE GAS

893

For a Bose gas of N non-interacting particles with mass m confined inside a box
potential of volume V = L3 the critical temperature for BEC can be calculated
from equation (25.3). The boundary conditions require that the momenta satisfy
pj = 2π~lj /L, where j = x, y or z and j are integers. Each state is labeled by a set
of three integers (lx , ly , lz ). In the thermodynamic limit, the sum over all quantum
states can be converted into an integral over a continuum of states,

For a free gas with energy ε = p2 /2m we can derive, simplifying the calculation
using the density of states η defined by (24.19), which basically depends on the geometry of our system 2 . Using the occupation number wT,µ (ε) for the Bose-Einstein
distribution (25.4) in the thermodynamic limit and the density-of-states in a box
potential (24.22), let us calculate the total number of particles,

explicit term N0 to the integral.

Condensation of a harmonically confined gas

The critical temperature Tc0 can be significantly altered, when the atoms are confined
to a spatially inhomogeneous potential. The critical temperature depends on the
general shape and the tightness of the potential. Let us consider N particles of an
ideal Bose gas distributed over several quantum states of an arbitrary potential. The
occupation number wT,µ (ε) of particles at an energy level ε is still given by (25.4),
the ground state energy is defined as zero. In the thermodynamic limit, the relation
between the chemical potential and the total number of particles is still given by
Eq. (25.9), with an adequate density of states η(ε). The state density for an arbitrary
confinement potential U (r) can be found by generalizing the calculation to the free
gas. The phase space volume between the energy surfaces ε and ε + dε is proportional
to the number of states in this energy range. However, the external potential limits the
space available for the gas. For a harmonic potential (24.18) with the mean secular
frequency ω̄ the density-of-states η(ε) has already been calculated in Eq. (24.21).
With this, we can analogically to (25.9) calculate,

in the thermodynamic limit.
We note that smaller trapping volumes (or tighter potentials) increase the critical
temperature Tc , thus allowing for quantum degeneracy at higher temperatures, which
can be advantageous in experimentation. Also, at a given temperature, a strongly
confining potential reduces the total minimum number of atoms required to reach
condensation.

25.1.3

Energy and heat capacity

When the number of atoms is limited, N < ∞, we expect a slightly reduced critical
temperature [256]. In addition, the interatomic interaction reduces the critical temperature [32]. The technical resolution of most experiments today is not sufficient to

permit the study of these effects. However, measurements of other thermodynamic
quantities such as energy and heat capacity [162, 203] showed significant deviations
from the ideal gas behavior due to interaction effects. Therefore, although temperature being the most basic variable of the thermodynamic state, the system needs to
be characterized by other quantities.
Heat is not a state variable because the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of the system depends on how the heat is transferred. The heat capacity
quantifies the system’s ability to secure its energy. In conventional systems, the heat
capacity is typically given either specified at constant volume or at constant pressure.
Together with this specification, heat capacities are extensive state variables. When
crossing a phase transition, the temperature-dependent heat capacity measures the
degree of change in the system above and below the critical temperature and provides
valuable information about the general type of phase transition.

For confined ideal gases, the virial theorem ensures Ekin + Epot = 2Ekin . For real

Eself . The sudden extinction of the trapping potential before time-of-flight takes away
the potential energy Epot non-adiabatically. The kinetic energy and the self-energy of
the condensate are fully converted into kinetic energy during ballistic expansion. It
is this energy, p2 /2m = Ekin + Eself , which is sometimes called release energy, which
is measured after ballistic expansion 4 . Fig. 25.4(right) shows a measurement of the
release energy. Solve the Exc. 25.1.5.3.

is interesting to measure the heat capacity of a partially condensed cloud near the critical
point and analyze the discontinuity, because it contains important information about interatomic
interactions and finite-size effects ([134], Seç. 3.4). In addition, the classification of Bose-Einstein condensation as a phase transition depends very much on the behavior of the thermodynamic potential
near the critical point [378, 307].

CHAPTER 25. THERMODYNAMICS OF IDEAL QUANTUM GASES

25.1.4

Distribution functions for a Bose gas

Bose-Einstein condensates consist of atoms sharing a single quantum state. In inhomogeneous potentials, the condensate and the thermal fraction form spatially separated clouds, concentrated around the center of the potential and therefore very
dense. For this reason, interatomic interaction effects generally dominate the density
and momentum distribution of the condensed fraction. However, the non-condensed
(or normal, or thermal) fraction is also subject to modifications due to the bosonic nature of the atoms. Since the density of the normal fraction is generally much smaller,
these modifications are weak. In this section, we will only discuss these effects briefly,
but we note that the calculations are analogous to the calculations for fermionic gases
presented in Sec. 25.2.4.
For an ideal Bose gas the density and momentum distributions are expressed by
Bose functions g3/2 (z) [134]. For example, as will be derived in Exc. 25.1.5.4(a), the
density and momentum distributions are,

This distribution does not directly depend on the potential U (r), that is, the expansion
is isotropic. However, the chemical potential does depend on the potential. For very
long flight times (usually several 10 ms) the density resembles a Gaussian distribution
[134]. In Exc. 25.1.5.4(b) we determine the time-of-flight density distribution of an
ultracold Bose gas.
In a time-of-flight experiment, any deviation observed between the results (25.30)
and (25.31) points towards an impact of quantum statistics. However, absorption
images only record projections of the time-of-flight distribution on a plane.
25.1.4.2

Temperature and excitations

The temperature of a Bose condensate is given by the ratio of the numbers of condensed and thermal atoms. What about collective excitations in pure condensate?
Can they be cooled? In fact, an oscillating BEC is not in thermal equilibrium. However, in the presence of some dissipation mechanism the excitations may thermalize
evolving towards a steady state. Once the collective excitations have become thermal
excitations, they simply increase the thermal fraction.

Exercises

25.1.5.1

Ex: Boson or fermion?

Whether an atom is a fermion or boson solely depends on its total spin. Half-integer
spin particles are fermions, integer spin particles are bosons. For example, Rb atoms
have in the ground state J = 1/2, I = 7/2 and F integer, and therefore are bosons.
Ca+ ions have J = 1/2 and no hyperfine structure, and thus are fermions. 6 Li has
the half-integer F and is a boson.
Decide on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the following atoms/molecules:
85
Rb with I = 3/2 in the state 2 S1/2
88
Sr with I = 0 in the state 1 S0
88
Sr with I = 0 in the state 3 P2

Sr with I = 9/2 in the state 1 S0

b. Using ζ of the previous item, obtain the system’s partition function Z and the

thermodynamic limit N −→ ∞, V −→ ∞, v = N/V fixed.
c. Obtain internal energy U and the gas pressure p.
d. Calculate the chemical potential and entropy per atom in the thermodynamic limit.
25.1.5.3

Ex: Generalization for arbitrary potentials in reduced dimensions

The calculation of the thermodynamic potentials can be generalized to arbitrary trapping potentials and dimensions [85, 198, 156, 33, 670, 216, 34, 256, 296, 354, 348, 461,
378, 388, 203]. To do so, we consider a generic power law potential confining an ideal
Bose gas in α dimensions,
Xα xi ti
U (r) =

i=1 ai

and define a parameter describing the confinement power of the potential,
ξ=

Quantum statistics of an ideal Fermi gas

Atoms are fermions or bosons, or depending on their spin is integer or semi-integer.
For example, 87 Rb atoms with their total integer spin of F are bosons, while 40 K
atoms having a half-integer spin are fermions. At high phase space densities, atoms
have to figure out how they will organize their coexistence. Bosons encourage each
other to occupy the same phase space cell, in contrast to the reluctant fermions,
which prefer to follow Pauli’s exclusion principle. The different behavior is described
by different quantum statistics that determine how the phase space (i.e., the available
energy levels) has to be filled by the atoms. The Bose-Einstein distribution is valid for
bosons, the distribution of Fermi-Dirac for fermions and both asymptotically approach
the Boltzmann distribution at high temperatures. We have seen that bosons undergo
a phase transition and condense in the ground state when the temperature is reduced
below a critical threshold. On the other hand, the fermions organize their phase
space, so that their energy levels are arranged like a ladder. The impact of fermionic
quantum statistics on a cold cloud of atoms were observed experimentally by DeMarco
and Jin [162, 469]. They cooled a two-components Fermi gas of 7 × 105 potassium
atoms down to 300 nK, which corresponded to 60% of the atoms populating energy
levels below the Fermi energy. The measured density distribution was found to deviate
from the one expected for an ideal Boltzmann gas 5 .
5 We note that meanwhile ultracold two-components Fermi gas have been demonstrated to form
bosonic Cooper-pairs, similarly to the phenomena known as superconductivity in some metals and

Chemical potential and Fermi radius for a harmonic
trap

The phase space density for a degenerate Fermi gas has already been given in (25.4). In
the same way as for a Bose gas, the chemical potential must satisfy the normalization

In the last line, we inserted the density of the states into a harmonic potential (24.21)
and used the definition of the Fermi functions (25.11).
For low temperatures, x ≡ µ  1, we can use the Sommerfeld expansion which in
first order gives fη (ex ) ' xη /Γ(η + 1). From this we immediately obtain the energy,
the Fermi radius and the momentum of free particles,

expect g() ∝ 3 and thus E = 4N kB T . In general, we may have more complicated
situations, where the trap becomes non-harmonic beyond a certain distance from the
origin. In those cases, the density of states may be approximated by series,

Such effects must be considered when the time-of-flight method is used for temperatures measurements. For example, if we underestimate g(ε) by assuming a harmonic

wrong estimate for the temperature Twrng = E/3N kB instead of Tcorr = E/4N kB .

Intensive and extensive parameters

The distinction between an intensive parameter and an extensive parameter is based
on the concept that the system under investigation can be subdivided into smaller,
identical and non-interconnected entities within which the parameter in question has
the same properties, such that this parameter does not change, when the system
is divided or subentities are combined 6 An intensive property is a global property,
meaning that it is a physical property of a system that does not depend on the system
size or the amount of material in the system. Examples of intensive properties are
the temperature and the hardness of an object. No matter how small a diamond is
cut, it maintains its intrinsic hardness.
By contrast, an extensive property is one that is additive for independent, noninteracting subsystems. The property is proportional to the amount of material in
the system. For example, both the mass and the volume of a diamond are directly
proportional to the amount that is left after cutting it from the raw mineral. Mass
and volume are extensive properties, but hardness is intensive.
The ratio of two extensive properties, such as mass and volume, is scale-invariant,
and this ratio, the density, is hence an intensive property.
Intensive parameter are: chemical potential, concentration, density (or specific
gravity), ductility, elasticity, electrical resistivity, hardness, magnetic field, magnetization, malleability, melting point and boiling point, molar absorptivity, pressure,
specific energy.
Extensive parameter are: energy, entropy, Gibbs energy, length, mass, particle
number, momentum, number of moles, volume, magnetic moment, electrical charge,
weight.

25.2.9

Signatures for quantum degeneracy of a Fermi gas

Whether an atom is a fermion or a boson uniquely depends on its total spin. Halfinteger spin particles are fermions, integer spin particles are bosons. E.g. Rb atoms have
in the ground state J = 1/2, I = 7/2, integer F , and are therefore bosons. Ca+ ions
have J = 1/2 and no hyperfine structure so that F is halfinteger, and are therefore
fermions. 6 Li has half-integer F and is a boson.
For a composite particle the quantum statistical nature may depend on the interaction strength of the partners. For weak interaction, e.g. Feshbach the total spins of
the partners will couple to a total total spin, which determines the nature of the composite particle. A fermion pairing with a fermion or a boson pairing with a boson will

be bosons. A fermion pairing with a boson will be a fermion. Composite trimers may
be either bosonic or fermionic depending on the coupling scheme. Can the quantum
nature change with the tightness of the binding? What is the total spin of a deeply
bound molecule? [514, 86, 237], [?, 301, 488, ?]

Superfluid suppression of sympathetic cooling

The fermions inside the bosonic cloud can be regarded as impurities. If they travel too
slow, v < c, and if the condensed fraction is too large, the motion will be frictionless
and thermalization stops. If they travel fast, quasiparticles are excited, which can
be√ removed by evaporation. With the typical velocity of sound in the BEC c =
2
~ 16πna/2mB ≈ 2 mm/s, or m
2 c ≈ kB × 20 nK, we see that this is no real danger.
25.2.9.3

Component separation

If the interspecies interaction h is stronger than the inter-bosonic interaction, the
components may separate [468]. Otherwise a small fermionic cloud stays inside the
BEC.

25.2.9.5

Modification of light scattering

The unavailability of final momentum states inhibits scattering in a similar way as the
Lamb-Dicke effect. Forward scattering is suppressed, because all small momentum
states are occupied. Furthermore, spontaneous emission is suppressed like in photonic
band gaps. However, here it is rather an atomic momentum band gap. Could it be
that because scattering is suppressed, in-situ images of fermions are hampered?
A condition for this effect to play a role is krec  kF . For Li the temperature

large Fermi gases.
25.2.9.6

Hole heating

Loss processes that remove particles from an atom trap leave holes behind in the
single particle distribution if the trapped gas is a degenerate fermion system. The
appearance of holes increases the temperature, because of an increase in the energy
share per particle if cold particles are removed. Heating is significant if the initial
temperature is well below the Fermi temperature. Heating increases the temperature
to T > TF /4 after half of the systems lifetime, regardless of the initial temperature.
The hole heating has important consequences for the prospect of observing Cooper
pairing in atom traps.

Bose-Einstein condensation
The experimental verification of Bose and Einstein’s prediction was for a long time
a cherished dream of many physicists. On the one hand, several phenomena have
been related to BEC in the past, for example, the phenomenon of superfluidity in
liquid helium and superconductivity. On the other hand, these strongly interacting
systems are not pure enough to clearly identify the role of BEC. In 1995, however,
Bose-Einstein condensation of weakly interacting confined atomic gases was achieved
in several laboratories [12, 155, 90, 273]. This success gave rise to a revolution in
atom optics documented in an enormous amount of theoretical and experimental
work. While initial work focused on the equilibrium thermodynamics of condensates
near the phase transition, very soon the dynamic response of condensates to perturbations was the subject of in-depth investigations, followed by the study of superfluid
characteristics, quantum transport phenomena, the interaction of condensates with
light, of condensed gas mixtures [458, 598], and the behavior of condensates in periodic potentials. To name only a few landmarks, we mention the creation of vortices
[409, 395] and quantum turbulence [292], the realization of various types of atom lasers
[422, 11, 71, 267] and atom interferometers with condensates [270, 365], the coherent
amplification of matter waves [313, 368, 315, 168], the creation of the Mott insulating states in optical lattices [247], the study of condensates in reduced dimensions
[449], the Anderson localization of atomic matter waves [110, 521], the observation
of Feshbach type collision resonances [137, 312, 633] and Efimov states [369, 43], the
creation of homonuclear molecular [248, 335, 141, 680, 668, 294] and heteronuclear
condensates [475] and degenerate Fermi gases [162], the observation of BCS type pairing [302, 249], the observation of matter wave superradiance [313] and the interaction
of condensates with optical cavities [578, 103] and with surfaces [52].
It is clearly unthinkable to discuss all matters in this course. Let us, however, give
a basic and practical introduction to atomic optics with condensates.

26.1

Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases

The challenge of the experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation is the
preparation of a very dense sample of very cold atoms. In practice, the first step
consists in providing an atomic gas, for example, of an alkali metal. This is done
by heating the metal in an oven (or sometimes in a dispenser). The atoms being
ejected from the metal and forming a hot gas are then forced through a nozzle out of
the oven, where they form a hot atomic beam. Some experiments employ a Zeeman
917

918

CHAPTER 26. BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION

slower, which is a device that decelerates the fast atoms of the beam by means of
a counterpropagating laser exerting a radiative pressure force. A position-dependent
magnetic field applied along the trajectory of the atoms is calculated in order to
compensate for the Doppler decreasing shift of the decelerated atoms and to ensure
that the laser always stays in resonance with an atomic transition (see Exc. 14.4.6.3).
Velocities around 30 m/s are realistic and low enough to allow the capture of the
atoms by a magneto-optical (MOT) trap. Usually, some 109 atoms are captured in a
few seconds.
MOTs do not only trap atoms, but simultaneously cool them down to the Doppler
limit of typically some 10 µK. Quasi-resonant optical traps, such as MOT, are afflicted
by the problem of radiation trapping (see Sec. 24.3.1), which limits the densities of
atomic clouds to typically 1011 cm3 . This corresponds (at temperatures close to the
Doppler limit) to phase space densities several orders of magnitude away from the
threshold to Bose-Einstein condensation. For this reason, the atoms are transferred
from the MOT to a potential exempt of radiative pressure force, for example, an
optical dipole potential or a magnetic trap.
Once the atoms are confined in such a conservative potential, all the light beams
are turned off, and the technique of evaporative cooling is activated (see Sec. 24.4.3).
That is, the effective potential is deformed (for example, by an irradiated radiofrequency) in a way to skim out hot atoms and leave behind a cooler sample. This
however supposes that the atomic cloud finds back to thermal equilibrium afterwards.
As the rethermalization happens by elastic collisions, a high atomic density is necessary, which is often achieved via a compression of the trapping potential. In general,
99.9% of the atoms must be sacrificed to condense the rest. Finally, the momentum
distribution is imaged after a time of free expansion. This is done by irradiation of a
probe laser pulse (see Fig. 24.31). The entire process of producing a condensed cloud
usually takes between 10 s and 60 s.

26.1.1

Condensate of alkaline gases

The first experimental observation of Bose-Einstein condensation was done with a
dilute rubidium gas by Cornell and Wieman at the Joint Institute for Laboratory
Astrophysics (JILA) [12]. A group from the University of Texas [273, 138] used
rubidium as well. A group led by Ketterle from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created the first sodium condensate. And a group led by Hulet from
Rice University opted for lithium [90, 88], which has a slightly negative scattering
length, a = −27.3aB . In this situation, only small condensates are expected to be
stable [532, 603], which explains the observation of a limited number of about 1400
condensed lithium atoms. Meanwhile, Bose-Einstein condensation has been achieved
with many other species, such as 1 H [220], 85 Rb [132], 4 He∗ [525], 133 Cs [583], 39 K
[503], 4 Ne [48], 88 Sr [595], or even molecules [667].

26.1.2

Condensation of hydrogen

Hydrogen is a very interesting element to study condensation, because its short scattering length, a ≈ 1.23aB , makes it an almost ideal gas. Consequently, the three-body
collision rate causing losses is weak, even at very high densities. Since the mass of

26.1. BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION OF DILUTE GASES

919

hydrogen is small, the critical temperature is high. The simplicity of its electronic
structure allows precise calculations of the interaction potentials based on fundamental principles, which can thus be tested experimentally.
Twenty years after having started the project of condensing dilute hydrogen gases,
Greytak and Kleppner [220] crossed the phase transition at a temperature of 50 µK
with an atomic density of 5 × 1015 cm−3 . The number of condensed atoms was 109 ,
which corresponds to a condensed fraction below 10% 1 . The condensed cloud had a
needle-like shape of 15 µm diameter and 5 mm length. It was detected by an in situ
measurement technique of the atomic velocity distribution.

Figure 26.1: Spectrum of condensed hydrogen.

26.1.3

Recognizing Bose-Einstein condensates

’How to recognize the presence of a condensate, what are its signatures?’ We have
already seen in Sec. 25.1.4 that, trapped inside a confinement potential, an ultracold
ideal Bose-gas has a modified density distribution when Bose-Einstein statistics come
into play. Below the critical temperature the density distribution is well described by
a superposition of a condensed cloud concentrated in the trap’s ground state and a
thermal cloud distributed over several vibrationally excited states. We thus expect
distinct distribution functions for both clouds, and the same is true for the momentum distribution. The splitting of the distribution functions in two fractions occurs
abruptly during the phase transition to quantum degeneracy. In a real gas, however,
the interatomic collisions have a drastic influence on the distribution functions and
the behavior of the gas at the phase transition, and we are obliged to develop a more
general theory in order to quantitatively understand the thermodynamic properties
(temperature, critical point, heat capacity, ...) through the measured static quantities
(density, number of atoms, condensed fraction, ...).
’What observables can be measured in the laboratory?’ In fact, with few exceptions, the only accessible quantity is the spatial density distribution of the atomic cloud
1 When the condensed fraction and the density are too high, losses induced by dipolar spin-flip
processes predominate over the gain due to evaporative cooling of the thermal cloud [299].

n(r) measured after a time of ballistic expansion. Information on non-trivial properties of the condensate, for example, its dynamic behavior (excitations, superfluidity,
turbulence, ...) or its coherent features (phase, correlations, ...), can only be gathered
through an observation of the condensate’s response to applied perturbations. Solve
the Excs. 26.1.5.1 and 26.1.5.2.

26.1.4

Photon condensation

An interesting question is that of the possibility of photon condensation and its relationship to the laser. The relationship is not that obvious because, on one hand
atomic condensates are produced by evaporating a ensemble in constant thermal
equilibrium, while on the other hand the photonic laser requires inversion, which is
a highly non-equilibrium situation. And under the constraint of having to reduce its
energy, a photon gas trapped in an optical cavity has the simpler alternative to let
photons escape into the void by annihilating them on the cavity walls, as it happens
for black-body radiation. Since the number of photons in a cavity is not conserved,
the chemical potential disappears, µ = 0. The density of states can be written,
u(ν) =

8πV E 2 dE
.
c3
h2

(26.1)

It is the same as in the Debye model. Planck’s formula now follows from,
u()d =

1
fBE ()ρ()d ,
V

(26.2)

where fBE is the Bose-Einstein distribution. Hence, the treatment of the photons
as indistinguishable particles following the Bose-Einstein distribution is equivalent to
assuming a Boltzmann distribution for waves with quantized energies.
Nevertheless, one can imagine a photonic gas in thermal equilibrium with an
atomic gas through Compton scattering [349]. In fact, photon condensation was
observed experimentally [356]. Also, there are theories about superfluid photon gases
[114] 2 .
2 Bose-Einstein condensation occurs in thermal equilibrium when entropy is maximized by putting
a macroscopic population of atoms into the ground state of the system. It might appear counterintuitive that an apparently highly ordered state as the Bose condensate maximizes entropy. However, only the particles in excited states contribute to the entropy. Their contribution is maximized
at a given total energy by forming a Bose condensate in the ground state and distributing the remaining atoms among higher energy states. A macroscopic population of atoms in the ground state
of the system is achieved simply by lowering the temperature of the sample. This is in contrast to
the optical laser where a non-equilibrium process is necessary to place a macroscopic population of
photons in a single mode of the electromagnetic field. This is due to the fact that, unlike photons,
the number of atoms is conserved. For bosonic atoms, the lowest entropy state below a certain temperature includes a macroscopic population of the ground state. In contrast, when one cools down
a blackbody cavity, the cavity empties. Photons do not Bose condense into the ground state of the
cavity, but are absorbed by the walls. The absorbed energy leads to a larger entropy than forming a
Bose condensate. The laser phenomenon requires inversion of the active medium characterized by a
’negative’ temperature. In that sense, ’lasing’ of atoms is a simpler phenomenon than lasing of light
–all you need to do is cool a gas! However, if a photon gas would thermalize while the number of
photons is conserved, it would be described by a Bose-Einstein distribution with non-zero chemical
potential and could form a Bose condensate. Thermalization with number conservation is possible,
for example, by Compton scattering with a thermal electron gas [349].

Quantum theory

As detailed above, interatomic interactions strongly influence the properties of BoseEinstein condensates, even their density and momentum distributions. For a correct
interpretation of the experimental measurements a theoretical many-body treatment
taking care of these interactions is compulsory. This is done through a description of
the atomic distribution as a scalar field of matter called second quantization, where
the atoms are treated as delocalized Broglie waves. However, we will leave a thorough
introduction of this formalism to to [638].

26.2.1

Description of the atom as a scalar field

In position space a state with n particles can be described in a canonically quantized
way by a field operator,
Ψ̂(r1 , ..., rn , t) = ψ̂ † (r1 , t) · ... · ψ̂ † (rn , t)Ψ̂0

,

ψ̂(r)Ψ̂0 = 0 ,

(26.3)

where Ψ0 is the vacuum state. The field operators ψ̂(r, t) and ψ̂ † (r, t) annihilate,
respectively create, an atom at position r and time t. This state represents a bosonic
Fock state and can be generated from the empty state by a sequence of individual
particle creation operators. Applying the notions and rules developed for the harmonic
oscillator in Sec. 3.6.1, we can define a coherent state of bosonic matter as,
|Φ̂(t)i =

(26.6)

The equations (26.5) and (26.6) represent the foundation of the theory of ultracold bosonic gases. However, to solve the equations, we will need to apply some
simplifications, which will be discussed in the following sections. For example, we will
generally assume that the temperature of the sample is T = 0, and that all atoms are
condensed. Also, in a first time, we will neglect quantum fluctuations, replacing field
operators with complex numbers. And finally, we will need to handle the nonlinear
term appearing in Hself and which signs responsible for collisions between atoms.

26.2.2

Quantum scattering at low temperatures

To simplify the term Hself , we have to go back to Secs. 12.2.5 (and following) and
study the phenomenon of the elastic collisions in the ultracold regime. For simplicity,
we consider two particles without internal degrees of freedom with masses m1 and
m2 approaching each other along the z-axis [123, 644]. Neglecting spin-spin and spinorbit interactions, the Schrödinger equation in the inertial center-of-mass system is
given by (12.115),


where r = r1 − r2 is the momentary interatomic separation, r = |r|, and mr ≡
m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ) is the reduced mass of atomic collision partners. We assume that
the interatomic potential, Vcoll (r), is spherically symmetrical. In the asymptotic
limit of large separations 4 , and in the Born-approximation (12.135), the solution of
Eq. (26.7) can be seen as the sum of an incident plane wave and a scattered spherical
wave modulated with a certain amplitude f (θ),

For a potential with finite range, that is, a potential falling faster than r−3 with the
distance (interatomic potentials usually fall as r−6 or r−7 ), the phase shift satisfies,
δ` ∝ k 2`+1

(26.12)

for small k. In ultra-cold gases, the collision energy is very low and k → 0. Thus
the scattering will be dominated by terms with ` = 0. This is the so-called limit of
s-wave scattering. In this limit the Eqs. (26.10) can be approximated as,
fk (θ) =

(26.13)

Scattering length

For ` = 0, taking the limit k → 0, we define the scattering length as via,
Im fk (θ)

Re fk (θ)

(26.14)

Therefore, the scattering length and cross section are given at very low temperatures
at the asymptotic boundary by,
as = −

δ0
k

and

σ = 4πa2s .

(26.15)

The scattering process can be interpreted as follows: During a collision, the system’s wavefunction undergoes a phase shift, δ0 , which may be positive or negative,
depending on the sign of as . If as < 0, the phase is ’delayed’ by the collision. This
corresponds to an attractive interaction. In contrast, if as > 0, the phase is ’advanced’
and the interaction is repulsive. Of course, the intensity of the interaction is proportional to the value of |as |. The expression for σ in Eq. (26.15) indicates, that the
atoms behave like hard spheres with radius |as |. The specific value of as will depend
on the interaction potential, however, the details of the potential are unimportant,
as all information about the collision is already contained in as . Consequently, in
the low-energy limit, we can assume that the collision is mediated by an effective
potential Vcoll (r), which has the particularity,

(26.17)
2
The interatomic interaction potential decides on the value of the scattering length
as : A repulsive potential corresponds to a positive as . For a purely attractive potential
that does not support bound states as is negative, and for an attractive potential that
supports bound states as may be positive or negative depending on the proximity of
the last bound vibrational state of the interaction potential below the dissociation
limit.
Vcoll (r, r0 ) =

26.2.4

The mean field approximation

The mean-field theory (MFT) or local density approximation (LDA) is based on the
assumption of hard sphere collisions between atoms (as described by the potential
(26.17)) propagating through a locally homogeneous mean-field potential, g2 |ψ̂(r)|2 .
The procedure is also called regularization of the interaction.
Thus, the mean-field energy of a condensate is proportional to the density of the
gas n and to a single atomic constant, which is the scattering length as . Its presence
in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation emphasizes its impact on shape, dynamic stability
and many other properties of the condensate. For example, the mean-field interaction
contributes to the broadening of a condensed wavepacket, and consequently contracts
its momentum distribution in comparison with an ideal gas. Homogeneous condensates with a negative scattering length are unstable, because the attempt of such a
condensate to lower its self-energy by increasing its density also increases the rate of
inelastic three-body collisions until the condensate collapses.

5 The Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov method (HFB) for the mean-field theory disregards corrections of

√
quantum depletion due to the correlation effects of the order of Nout /N = 85 π a3 n0 . The theory mean-field supposes the Rvalidity of the Born approximation, that is, two-body correlations are
neglected, ψ̂(r0 ) ≈ ψ̂(r) and d3 RVcoll (R) = g2 .

26.3. APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS OF THE GROSS-PITAEVSKII EQUATION925
Remember that, despite their symbol ψ̂, which usually is associated to wavefunctions, and the fact that they satisfy a non-linear Schrödinger equation the field operators are represented by matrices acting of many-body states. That is, Eq. (26.20)
also represents a Heisenberg equation for the field operators.
A common approximation is the Bogolubov prescription, where the field operators
describing the condensate and its fluctuations are decomposed into a complex function, ψ0 (r) ≡ hψ̂(r)i called condensed wavefunction, which can be chosen as the order
parameter of the system, and a small perturbation, δ ψ̂(r) ≡ ψ̂(r) − ψ0 (r) describing
thermal excitations. At zero temperature, we can neglect the excitations [45], and our
system is completely described by a single wavefunction, ψ0 (r, t), obeying the famous
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE),

Spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry

The description of a condensate by a single macroscopic wavefunction means that we
attribute a well-defined phase to it. However, the GPE does not allow us to predict, which phase between 0 and 2π this will be, and we have to assume, that the
BEC chooses its phase spontaneously when it undergoes the phase transition to quantum degeneracy. This principle is called spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry 6 .
In Exc. 26.2.6.2 we study the relation between the fact of having exactly N atoms
in a condensate and a well-defined phase ϕ, knowing that these two quantities are
conjugate variables having to satisfy a Heisenberg uncertainty relation.

One of the primary characteristics of a condensate is its phase coherence. Now,

Ideal gas in a harmonic potential

Most experiments apply non-isotropic (often cylindrical) potentials, which are additionally distorted by the mean-field. Hence, the non-linear term of the GPE is
important, and the spatial coordinates can not be separated. However, assuming an
ideal gas and a harmonic potential, the dimensions could be separated, as demonstrated in Sec. 3.5.5, even when the potential is not isotropic. It is then sufficient to
consider one-dimensional problems with g = 0,

from which, using the variational condition (26.18), we have derived the GrossPitaevskii equation (26.21). Hence, the wavefunction ψ0 minimizes the functional
[183]. By inserting an ansatz for the wavefunction with adjustable parameters, the
functional provides conditions to optimize these parameters.
The variational method is useful e.g. for finding the ground state wavefunction
of a condensate in an arbitrarily shaped trap or to perform a stability analysis of a
condensate with attractive interatomic forces.

This problem of finding the ground state wavefunction of a condensate consists in
finding the ψ for which

has the form H[ψ] = f [ψ, ∇ψ]d3 r. The fastest way to the minimum is to reduce the

26.3. APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS OF THE GROSS-PITAEVSKII EQUATION929
This procedure is repeated until the function converges. Since this method is derived
from a variational principle, it only serves to find the ground state of the trapping
potential. It can not be used for excited states (with the exception of vortex states,
where in cylindrical coordinates the Hamiltonian differs by an additional centrifugal
term).
26.3.3.2

Collapse and stabilization of condensates with attractive interactions

Attractive interactions destabilize a Bose-Einstein condensate. Since the interaction
energy, 4π~2 as n/m, of a condensate with negative scattering length decreased with
increasing density n, the condensate attempts to lower its interaction energy by increasing its density until it succumbs to inelastic two-body spin-changing collisions of
to three-body collisions leading to the formation of molecules [603]. Strictly speaking, this only holds true for homogeneous condensates. In the presence of a trapping
potential, however, the zero-point energy exerts a kinetic pressure, which counteracts
the condensate collapse to a certain extent, such that small condensates are stabi2
2
lized. This can be verified by inserting a Gaussian wavefunction ψ0 ∝ e−r /2r̄ into
the energy functional (26.34). Varying the radius r̄ of the condensate, we find a local
minimum where the condensate is stable. Calculations for spherical traps predict

26.4

Elementary excitations

The dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates is usually studied by observing the change
of their shape in response to temporal variations in the trapping potential. The simplest variation surely consists in suddenly removing the trapping potential altogether.
Consequently, the first experiment performed with a BEC was the study of its ballistic
expansion [12, 204, 108] (see Sec. 26.7.1).
On the other hand, the temporal variation of the potential can also be a small
oscillatory or pulsed perturbation, for example, a small modification of the amplitude
of the trapping field, a displacement or a local anisotropy induced by the dipole force
of a laser beam tuned far away from resonance. It is even conceivable to manipulate
the self-energy of the condensate or to irradiate electromagnetic waves, which couples
internal atomic excitation levels or states of the atomic motion [45, 13, 592, 333,
424, 575, 195, 604, 334, 471, 591, 232]. The response of the condensate to such

small perturbations can be understood by a linearized model of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, which we will present in the following sections.

26.4.1

Bogolubov spectrum of excitations

To analyze the spectrum of a condensate’s response to small perturbations, let us
follow Bogolubov’s treatment of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation [589].
We start by substituting Eq. (26.20) [194],

for all k is the Landau criterion for the superfluidity of the condensate. It means that,
for an object being dragged through the condensate with a velocity less than cs , it does
not become energetically favorable to produce excitations, see Fig. 26.4. Therefore,
the object will move without dissipation, which is an important characteristic of
superfluids. Experiments demonstrated this manifestation of superfluidity by slowly
stirring a strongly focused blue-detuned laser through a condensate. We will come
back to this in Sec. 27.1.1.

Classification of normal modes

BECs often have cylindrical symmetry, ψ(r) = ψ0 (r, z). In this case, similar calculations to those shown above, result in analytical expressions for the frequencies of
the elementary excitations. These frequencies were derived by [145] 7 . The modes
can be classified by their main quantum numbers nr and by their multipolar moment
`. Examples are the surface excitation or shape oscillation (nr = 0) and the compression oscillation (nr 6= 0). Special cases are called shaking mode, breathing mode
(nr = 1, ` = 0), and swirling mode. In the case of cylindrical symmetry, the projection of the angular momentum onto the symmetry axis m is the relevant quantum
7 It is worth mentioning that the linearized theory applies to small perturbations. Strong disturbances render the dynamics chaotic, since the energy is coupled to many modes of excitation.

Exercises
Ex: Sound velocity in the Thomas-Fermi regime

Consider a condensate of N = 105 87 Rb atoms confined to an isotropic harmonic
potential with secular frequency ωtrp = (2π) 50 Hz. Remember as = 110aB and use
the Thomas-Fermi approximation.
a. Evaluate the chemical potential.
b. Calculate the sound velocity at the center of the condensate.

26.5

Hydrodynamics and the propagation of sound

The question arises how the elementary excitations relate to the phenomenon of sound,
well known from the hydrodynamic theory of superfluid 4 He proposed by Landau
[378]. The hydrodynamic regime is characterized by the dominance of collisions 8 . On
the other hand, Bogolubov’s theory describes elementary excitations in the collisionless regime, where quasi-particles do not interact 9 . There is, therefore, a great
motivation to study excitations with condensates in a very dense regime, where one
can expect to recover predictions of hydrodynamic theory.
The hydrodynamic regime is reached, when the free path of the particles is smaller
than the wavelength of the sound, that is 10 ,
lmf p < λ/2π .

26.5.1

(26.65)

Zero, first and second sound

The occurrence of several types of sound was related by Tisza and London to the
existence of superfluid and normal components in 4 He [464]. The second sound is a
quantum phenomenon, where the heat transfer occurs as an wave-like motion instead
of being diffusive. Heat takes the place of pressure in normal sound waves called first
sound. This induces a very high thermal conductivity. At temperatures below the
λ-point, 4 He has the highest known conductivity of all materials (a few hundred times
higher than copper).
The zero sound was introduced by Landau to name quantum vibrations in Fermi
quantum liquids. This sound can not be seen as a simple wave of compression and
rarefaction. In gaseous condensates, the zero sound corresponds to the elementary
excitation called phonon-like.
Finally, the excitation called particle-like or ballistic, observed in gaseous condensates has no correspondence in dense superfluids, since the mean free path there is too
short. The various regimes accessible in condensed gasses are listed in the following
table [13, 15, 252, 346, 570, 592, 591, 215]:
8 Collisions prevent condensation, because they localize the particles. This is the reason for the
large quantum depletion, which in 4 He is of the order of 10% and hides effects of quantum statistics.
Quantum depletion prevents any form of long-range order, as this requires delocalization.
9 Bogolubov’s theory assumes that the only impact of collisions is to deform the dispersion relationship, keeping the collective modes orthogonal.
10 Note the similarity to the Ioffe-Regel criterion.

Density (arb. unit.)

condensate densities n0 ranging from 1 to 5 ×1014 cm−3 (fig. 18). The data were compared with the
prediction of Bogoliubov theory, cs = (4πh̄2 an/m2 )1/2 , where the variation of the condensate density
across the radius of the cloud is accounted for by using n = n0 /2 [224, 225, 220]. The agreement between
the data and this theory was good except at low density where the assumption that the sound pulse is

Condensates at finite temperature

26.7.1

Ballistic expansion of a bosonic gas

As discussed in Sec. 24.6, the atomic density distributions are revealed through their
interaction with a laser beam. The problem with imaging a confined condensate
is, on the one hand, its very high optical density, which inhibits the penetration of
resonant light and, on the other hand, its very small size, which is often below the
diffraction limit and prevents its optical resolution. As discussed in Sec. 24.6, both
problems can be avoided by the time-of-flight imaging technique, which consists in
quickly switching off the trap and dropping the atomic cloud (see Fig. 24.30). If the
switching-off process is fast enough, the potential energy is lost, but in the course of
ballistic expansion, the self-energy is transformed into kinetic energy. Both the selfenergy transformed to kinetic energy and the inherent initial kinetic energy contribute
to blow up the size of the atomic cloud, so that the density rapidly decreases. After
a few 10 ms, when the optical density is sufficiently low (on the order of 1), the cloud
can be imaged via its absorption of a resonant laser beam. The condensate, which is
about 10 times denser than the thermal cloud, has a much larger repulsive self-energy.
When the condensate is suddenly released from its trap, its explosion is accelerated by
this self-energy, and the acceleration is faster in those directions, where the confining
potential was stronger [304, 108]. Therefore, the aspect ratio of the condensate’s
shape is inverted during the flight time [349, 108]. In contrast, the self-energy of the
thermal cloud is relatively insignificant. Therefore, its spatial density after a time of
free expansion reflects the pure velocity distribution of the atomic cloud while it was
trapped. This allows the interpretation of the spatial distribution of the expanded
cloud in terms of a temperature of the trapped cloud.

CHAPTER 26. BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION

26.7.2

Hartree-Fock approach

26.7.2.1

Two-gas model for T > 0

The two phases of a condensate above T = 0 have a specific interdependence, which
makes it possible to treat the problem with an approximation, where only the condensed part influences the non-condensed and not vice versa [184]DOI . The HFB
equation (III.2.11) is solved for the condensed part alone, assuming nth = 0. The
condensate wavefunction and the chemical potential are derived from that, f.e. using
numerical methods like the method of steepest descent. The effective potential for
the thermal cloud in the presence of a condensate is:
V1,ef f (r1 ) = V1,trap (r1 ) + g1 |ψ1 (r1 )|2 .

(26.97)

Next, we diagonalize the Schrödinger equation:
[−∇21 + V1,ef f (r1 )]ψ1,j (r1 ) = 2E1,j ψ1,j (r1 ) ,

(26.98)

maintaining the normalization,
1=

Z

|ψ1,j (r1 )|2 d3 r1 .

(26.99)

This provides us with the energy eigenvalues of the excited trap states and their
eigenfunctions. One can f.e. guess an eigenvalue and numerically solve the Schrödinger
equation using Runge-Kutta integration routines. The eigenfunction will probably
diverge. In this case, we vary the eigenvalue until the solution converges.
Finally, we can calculate the thermal density distribution:,
Nj ≡ [exp((E1,j − µ1 )/kB T1 ) − 1]
X
nth (r1 ) =
Nj |ψ1,j (r1 )|2 ,

−1

(26.100)

j

and all thermodynamic potentials, as shown in Sec. 25.1.2.
A more sophisticated method uses self-consistent recursion [310]. Here, the thermal density is plugged back into the HFB equation, and the whole procedure is
repeated until it converges.
26.7.2.2

Hartree-Fock approximation

We have already seen that, inside a trap the condensate occupies the lowest vibrational level, whereas the atoms of the thermal gas are distributed among all levels.
2 2
The trapping potential is often harmonic, Utrp (r) = m
2 ωr r , with secular frequencies
ωr typically on the order of several tens or hundreds of Hz. The spatial
p (radial) extent
of the vibration levels varies a lot with their quantum number, rj = (2j + 1)~/mωr .
This naturally produces a separation of the thermal (or normal) and condensate fractions at T > 0, which does not exist for a homogeneous gas and which allows (up
to a certain degree) an individual treatment of the two fractions. The details of the
interaction between the two fractions are very complicated and are still under intense
theoretical investigation. However, to understand the shape of a trapped atomic cloud
and other characteristics, we can use a simple approximate model [?, 310], assuming

26.7. CONDENSATES AT FINITE TEMPERATURE

945

that the condensate is only weakly disturbed by the thermal cloud. In contrast, the
presence of the condensate dramatically modifies the potential for the thermal atoms.
Therefore, we must first calculate the density of the condensate n0 (r), before calculating that of the thermal cloud. If this procedure is applied iteratively, it is called
Hartree-Fock method:

is a parabolic partial differential equation. We usually seek a solution on an interval
x ∈ [a, b] and t > 0. The solution is uniquely determined from boundary conditions:
ψ(a, t) = ψ(b, t) = 0 and ψ(x, 0) = g(x). One method for numerical solution solves
for the values of the wavefunction on a regular grid of dimension h = (b − a)/Nx in x
and τ in t:,
ψjk = ψ(a + jh, kτ ) .
(26.107)
The derivatives are replaced by simple finite differences. The r.h.s. of the equation at

or

(26.109)

which, when combined with the r.h.s. gives the explicit algorithm,
ψ k+1 = (1 + iHτ )ψ k

or

ψ k = (1 − ıHτ )ψ k+1 .

(26.110)

The Crank Nicholson Algorithm averages both,
(1 − ıHτ /2)ψ k+1 = (1 + ıHτ /2)ψ k .

(26.111)

This method is a second order algorithm in t, i.e. the discretization error decreases
as τ 2 . The finite difference representation of the second derivative d2 /dx2 is also good
to second order in h2 . The Crank-Nicholson Algorithm also gives a unitary evolution
in time. That is especially useful for quantum mechanics where unitarity assures that
the normalization of the wavefunction is unchanged over time. The algorithm steps
the solution forward in time by one time unit, starting from the initial wavefunction
at t = 0. According to the Crank-Nicholson scheme, the time stepping process is half
explicit and half implicit. The implicit part involves solving a tridiagonal system.
That solution is accomplished by Crout reduction, a direct method related to Gaussian
elimination and LU decomposition.
To simplify the algorithm we have chosen units in which the Planck constant ~ = 1,
time step τ = 1 and the spatial separation h = 1. This can always be arranged by an
appropriate redefinition of mass and potential: m = mSI h2 /τ ~ and V = VSI τ /h.

Superfluid and coherent
properties of Bose-Einstein
condensates
Superfluid liquids or gases are distinguished by their ability to sustain flow without
dissipation, i.e. flow which is free of viscous damping. The phenomenon of superfluidity is a well-known property of liquid 4 He, but the relationship between superfluidity
and Bose-Einstein condensation in this strongly interacting system is not trivial. The
situation is much simpler in weakly interacting Bose gases, where the superfluid fraction is almost identical with the condensed fraction and the normal phase of the fluid
with the thermal fraction. The availability of dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensates
now offers the unique opportunity to study the complicated interdependence between
superfluidity and condensation.

27.1

Superfluidity in quantum gases

The superfluidity of a gaseous condensate, which is one of its most apparent properties,
is intrinsically linked to interatomic collisions. To characterize this phenomenon, it is
useful to define some parameters. In the local-density approximation, the homogeneity
of a gas of N atoms with the thermal de Broglie wavelength (24.9) confined inside a
harmonic trap with the ground state size defined by (3.79), is characterized by,
2πa2trp
kB T

~ωtrp

(27.1)

For a typical experimental situation, kB T /~ωtrp ≈ N 1/3 ≈ 100. This shows that the
assumption of a locally homogeneous gas is generally a good approximation. With
the definition of the healing length (26.69), the degree of superfluidity of a condensate
with density n can be cast into the form,

955

(27.2)

956 CHAPTER 27. SUPERFLUID AND COHERENT PROPERTIES OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CON
For a typical experimental situation, a2trp /ξ 2 ≈ 100. A parameter that well characterizes the importance of interatomic forces within a condensate is the gas dilution,
na3s =

a2s
.
8πξ 2

(27.3)

The typical numerical value na3s ≈ 10−5 shows, that atomic gases are usually very
dilute, although interatomic forces play an important role in the dynamics of condensates. In contrast, three-body collisions can be totally neglected, because the
probability to have three atoms close to each other is even lower than the probability
for two atoms.
There are several manifestations of phenomena linked to superfluidity, such as
the behavior of collective elementary excitations, superfluid flow of non-circulating
topological modes, quantized flux in vortices and matter wave solitons, which will be
discussed in the following sections.

27.1.1

Landau’s criterion for superfluidity

According to Landau, the phenomenon of superfluidity is rooted in the particular
character of the Bogolubov spectrum of elementary excitations (26.54). Let us consider a bosonic fluid at a given temperature moving with velocity v. A macroscopic
obstacle in the path of the superfluid can generate elementary excitations. That is, a
fraction of the kinetic energy of the fluid is transferred to these excitations, thereby
decelerating the fluid and causing viscosity. With the excitation energy E(p) and the
momentum p, the total energy of the fluid interacting with the obstacle is,
E = E(p) +

(p + M v)2
p2
= E(p) + p · v + 12 M v 2 +
' E(p) + p · v + 12 M v 2 , (27.4)
2M
2M

where M is the total mass of the superfluid. Since the term M v 2 /2 is the initial
kinetic energy of the fluid, E(p) + p · v represents the excitation energy. And since
the kinetic energy of the superfluid can only be diminished by the excitation, we need
E(p) + p · v < 0. Finally, as E(p) must be positive, the condition for generating
elementary excitations is,
E(p) ≤ pv ,
(27.5)
where p and v are antiparallel.
Therefore, there is a relative minimum velocity between the fluid and the obstacle,
called critical Landau velocity, for creating excitations,


E(p)
.
(27.6)
vc = min
p
For velocities below vc , it is impossible to generate excitations, and there is no mechanism to decrease the kinetic energy of the fluid. As a result, the system becomes
superfluid [378].
The spectrum of elementary excitations for a weakly interacting condensate, is
the Bogolubov spectrum (26.54). The graph Fig. 27.1 shows, that for velocities below
the sound velocity given by (26.56), v < cs , the curve representing the propagation of

27.1. SUPERFLUIDITY IN QUANTUM GASES

957

the perturbation does not cross the Bogolubov spectrum. That is, the perturbation
can not be converted into excitations, which is only possible when v > cs .
In an ideal condensate without interactions, as = 0, the Bogolubov spectrum
reduces to the quadratic dispersion relation of free particles, which means that there
is no critical velocity, vc = cs . Consequently, it is always possible to excite the
condensate, that is, an ideal condensate can not be superfluid, and, as first pointed out
by Landau: superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation are different phenomena.

27.1.2

Impurity scattering

A first hint for the superfluid nature of Bose-Einstein condensates is the fact that
the hydrodynamic theory of superfluidity describes well the collective excitations (see
Sec. ??). Moreover, several experiments provided direct evidence for the superfluid
nature of condensates. For example, via a calorimetric measurement [511]: A condensate, stirred around by a rotating far blue-detuned laser beam, dissipated atoms
to the thermal fraction of the atomic cloud, provided the stirring velocity exceed a
certain critical velocity vc : At lower velocities, the perturbation did not lead to dissipation. At higher velocities, phonons were excited and the cloud was heated. In
a subsequent experiment, perturbation-induced density fluctuations were observed in
vivo and in situ [472]. When the stirring speed was below the critical velocity, the
density was almost homogeneous, thus indicating superfluid flow. When, however,
the stirring speed exceeded vc , atoms piled up in front of the stirring beam, and the
resulting pressure gradients led to a turbulent flow around the perturbation and to
dissipation.
The critical velocity vc found in the stirring experiments was about ten times
smaller than the local sound velocity cs ,

In fact, while the onset of dissipation is accelerated by turbulence around the macroscopic object traversing the superfluid, the local sound velocity (27.8) is derived for

a microscopic object. Puzzled by this discrepancy, Chikkatur et al. [115] studied the
motion of microscopic atomic impurities through a condensate. The impurity was
created by transferring a few atoms out of the original BEC from the trapped state
|F = 1, mF = −1i to the free state |F = 1, mF = 0i via induced Raman transitions.
The initial velocity was adjusted by the laser beams exciting the Raman transition
(polarization, incident angle and relative detuning) to satisfy the Bragg condition (see
Sec. 28.2). After the free impurity passed through the BEC, the trap was switched
off, a Stern-Gerlach magnetic field gradient was pulsed to separate atoms in different
Zeeman states, and finally the atoms were detected via time-of-flight imaging (see
Sec. 24.6.1). When the initial velocity of the impurity was well above a critical value
given by the local velocity of sound, ultracold s-wave collisions between impurity
atoms and the stationary condensate distributed the momenta of the collision partners uniformly. In TOF images this appeared as a circular halo centered around the
center-of-mass momentum of the collision partners (see Fig. 27.2). When, however,
the initial velocity of the impurity was reduced, its collision rate with the stationary
condensate was suppressed and the trajectory became superfluid.

Figure 27.2: (a) Scattering of impurities at velocities above the critical velocity. The presence
of a halo indicates the occurrence of collisions between the impurity and the condensate
dissipating the relative kinetic energy. (b) For velocities below the critical velocity the halo
disappears.

27.1.3

Hydrodynamic theory of superfluidity

For the description of superfluidity a hydrodynamic theory is adequate. Therefore,
we will rewrite the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation (26.21). We consider
the general case, in which the external potential Vtrp (r, t) depends on time. The
wavefunction can be written by defining the density and the velocity fields,
p

(27.11)

This is the Euler equation for a fluid with a potential flow. This equation and the
continuity equation have the typical structure of equations describing superfluids at
T = 0. This is due 1. to the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate allowing us
to formulate an equation for a complex order parameter, and 2. to the presence of
interactions, included via the pressure term in the Euler equation, which are necessary
condition for superfluidity.
At zero temperature, the entire fluid is superfluid. Moreover, in the GrossPitaevskii approximation, the whole fluid is condensed. Therefore, vs (r, t) is the
velocity flow of the superfluid 1 .

27.2

Topological modes

Significant manifestations of superfluidity are associated with rotational phenomena.
An example is the occurrence of scissor modes [260], which are excited, when an
angular momentum is suddenly applied to a condensate confined in an anisotropic
trap. This can be done via a sudden reorientation of the symmetry axis of the trap
[400, 399]. The condensate responds to this perturbation by an oscillation of its
inclination implemented by an irrotational superfluid flow. The excitation spectrum
reflects the strong reduction of the inertial momentum for superfluids.
The most rigorous manifestation of superfluidity, however, is the occurrence of a
quantized and persistent current, called quantized vortex. In contrast to the elementary excitations, which must be created by perturbations, the vortex is a stationary
(or topological mode) solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation Eq. (26.21).
Work on vortices has been done by [410, 395, 511, 472, 115, 260, 400, 396, 113,
10, 528, 182, 321, 102, 677].

27.2.1

Vortices

From Eq. (27.9) it is easy to see, that the superfluid is non-rotational, that is,
∇ × vs (r, t) = 0 .

(27.12)

This raises the question, how vortices are possible. The solution to this apparent
contradiction is, that Eq. (27.12) does not apply, when the phase exhibits a singularity.
Consider, for example, a closed loop C around the singularity. In a vortex, the
~
superfluid current is pulled by the phase gradient, v = m
∇θ. For the condensate
wavefunction to be well defined, the phase variation ∆θ around the loop must be a
multiple of 2π, that is,

∆θ =
∇θ · dl = 2π` .
(27.13)

where ` is an integer. Therefore, we can calculate the circulation Γ around the closed
loop, that is,
I

(27.14)
m
C
Apparently, the superfluid circulation is quantized in units of ~/m. The parameter
` is called charge of the vortex and measures, in unit of h, the quantized angular
momentum of the vortex.
In addition, the flow must be persistent, because its circulation can only be
changed in a discontinuous way, by overcoming a discrete energy barrier, which requires energy coming e.g. from thermal excitations. Clearly, the normal (thermal)
fraction of a gas can also have a circular flow. However, the disordered microscopic
motion of each individual particle causes a viscous drag that prevents the persistence
of the flow in the absence of a torque. This is in contrast to superfluid flow, which
persists even without external torque. The issues of vortex stability, formation, and
topology were addressed in recent experiments [409, 395, 396, 113, 10]. Solve the
Excs. 27.2.6.1 and 27.2.6.2.
The kinetic energy per unit vortex length can be estimated from a semi-classical
approach. First, we define as the mass density ρm of the superfluid. If n is the particle
density, ρm = nm. The kinetic energy of a flux line at the radius r is,
Ekin = 12 ρm vs2 =

~2 `2 n
.
2m r2

(27.15)

To obtain the kinetic energy per unit length, we integrate the expression (27.21) over
a plane perpendicular to the vortex axis. Note, however, that the velocity field is
vs ∝ r−1 and, therefore, can not be integrated from zero. Instead, we begin the
integration at a radius given by the healing length ξ, which represents a measure of
the vortex core size. Now, the kinetic energy per unit length is,

Note, that a multiply charged vortex carrying the entire angular momentum ` = `0
of the superfluid is energetically less favorable than an ensemble of `0 vortices with
unit charge ` = 1. Therefore, a multiply charged vortex is unstable and may decay
to several single charge vortices.
To calculate exactly the energy of a vortex, we do the following ansatz,
Φ0 (r) = φ(r, z)ei`ϑ ,

(27.17)

we then solve the Gross-Piatevskii equation (26.21) numerically, and calculate the
expectation value of the energy of the vortex through the expression,

27.2.1.1

Creation and detection of vortices

The first superfluid vortex was observed 1979 in 4 He [673]. For gaseous condensates,
two approaches have been employed to produce vortices. Either one stirs the atomic
cloud in order to impart an angular momentum to it. This can be done by rotating
the (anisotropic) trap during the process of forced evaporation with time-orbiting
magnetic fields or with an optical spoon. The vortex state is formed when the critical
temperature for condensation is crossed. An alternative method is to imprint a 2π
circular phase gradient into a previously created condensate. Indeed, the local phase
of a matter wave can be manipulated via a local modification of the potential depth,
which can be achieved by a Stark shift induced by a far-detuned laser beam [182].
Focused into a tiny spot which is moved across the condensate, the laser beam will
create a phase gradient, which in turn will cause a velocity flow. It is important to
force the local density at the center of the vortex to zero, which can be achieved via
a proper design of the trapping potential (e.g., a Mexican hat-shaped potential), and
let the BEC then relax to the vortex state.
A variation of this method [653] avoids the need for relaxation processes. In this
configuration the phase gradient is created through a local Raman coupling between
two internal atomic states (for example, in 87 Rb the two trappable Zeeman states
|F, mF i = |1, −1i to |2, 1i). At the spots, where the focused Raman beams hit the
condensate, atoms were dynamically converted from the ground state to the excited
state. The circular trajectory of the spots and the rotation speed were calculated such
as to generate a toroidal topology for the adiabatic population transfer. The process
was coherent and allowed to directly construct and shape the vortex wave function.
We study this experiment in more detail in the Exc. 27.2.6.3.
In confined single-species condensates the diameter of the vortex core is on the
order of the healing length, 2ξ. With typical values of 2ξ ≈ 0.4 µm it is thus way
too small to be imaged in situ, and ballistic expansion times of several 10 ms are
necessary. On the other hand, in double condensates formed by two repelling species
(e.g. the two states |2, 1i and |1, −1i in 87 Rb), one of the species can form a vortex
around the second. In this case, the diameter of the vortex core, is determined by
the diameter of the condensate of the second species and, hence, much larger. When

of the confined density distribution [410].
A particularly smart detection method for vortices is based on matter wave interferometry (see Sec. 27.3.3). Here, two matter waves, that is, the vortex state in
|2, 1i and a (reference) ground state BEC in |1, −1i are coherent mixed via a resonant two-photon radiofrequency π/2-pulse. The resulting matter wave interference
patterns reveals the phase profile of the vortex (see Fig. 27.3).
27.2.1.2

Stability

In a topologically ’singly-connected’ trap, for example a potential harmonic, vortices
do not represent the lowest energy eigenstate, and they must decay to the ground
state. If the mean-field energy of the condensate is weak compared to the kinetic
energy, gn0 /~ωz  1, the healing length will exceed the size of the BEC, ξ  atrp ,
and the vortex rapidly decays by dissipating its excess energy to thermal excitation.
Such BECs can not be considered superfluid. If the mean-field interaction is strong,
the vortex spontaneously breaks azimuthal symmetry, moves away from the center
and exits the condensate on a spiral-shaped trajectory [528]. Nevertheless, the decay
time may be quite long.
On the other hand, a vortex can be the ground state of a ’multiply-connected’
trap (for example, a toroidal potential). Such a potential can be realized as the
temporal average of a harmonic potential with a small rotating anisotropy [395]. In
such geometries vortices are extremely stable.
27.2.1.3

Vortex precession

A radial force acting on a vortex results in a radial displacement and a precession
about the symmetry axis. The effect, known as Magnus effect [321], is due to pressure

27.2. TOPOLOGICAL MODES

963

imbalances on the vortex surface. A radial force naturally arises, when the core is
displaced from the center, because local pressure gradients will force the vortex out
of the center toward regions with lower densities. Experimentally, a slow precession
(∼ 1 Hz) spiraling the vortex toward the rim of the condensate has been observed
[10] by taking a succession of nondestructive images.

27.2.2

Vortex lattices

Superfluid 4 He in a rotating bucket spontaneously develops symmetrically organized
vortex patterns. Similar phenomena can be observed, when a dilute gas Bose-Einstein
condensate is forced to rotate [102] at a given frequency Ω. The energy in the rotating system receives an additional contribution from the centrifugal term, Urot (r) =
Utrp (r) − ΩLz , where Lz = ~N lz , and lz = i(y∂x − x∂y ) is the angular momentum
of the individual atoms. If the rotation is slow, the energy ΩLz is too small to force
the condensed wavefunction to rotate. If the rotation frequency is beyond a critical
value Ωc , the time-averaged potential, Urot (r) eventually develops a local minimum
in the center, thus adopting the toroidal shape. For non-interacting gases, the critical frequency coincides with the radial secular frequency, Ωc = ωr . Then the radial
restoring force of the trap does not balance the centrifugal force, such that atoms can
escape from the trap. However, for superfluid gases the critical frequency is reduced,
Ωc < ωr . Between the rotation frequencies Ω = Ωc and Ω = ωr , the state with the
lowest energy in the toroidal potential is the vortex, whose filament is pinned to the
symmetry axis. For even higher rotation frequencies, we could expect a single vortex
with a larger winding number (more than the phase winding of 2π for a single turn).
However, individual multiple-order vortices in harmonic traps are unstable. Instead,
vortex lattices [102] called Abricosov lattices will form. For a given trapping potential and mean-field energy, the symmetry of the lattice and the number of vortices
depend on the rotation frequency Ω. Counter-intuitively, the angular momentum of
individual particles lz is not quantized. When we vary Ω, regimes of forbidden lz
(i.e. when no vortex pattern is formed) alternate with allowed regimes. The discontinuous transition from one vortex pattern to another is a first-order phase transition,
which spontaneously breaks one symmetry to form another. An upper limit for the
rotation speed is given by the equilibrium between the centrifugal force and the radial
restoring force of the trapping potential at Ω = ωr .

Figure 27.4: Abricosov vortex lattice.

These patterns of vortex lattices were observed in experiments using the stirring method, which consists in brushing a far-detuned focused laser (’optical spoon’)
around the rim of a condensate [395] at a certain frequency Ω. In this experiment, the
ratio of the mean-field energy to the kinetic energy was gn0 /~ωz = a2trp /2ξ 2 > 100.
Beyond a certain critical rotation frequency, Ωc ≈ 2π × 150 Hz, a single central vortex

964 CHAPTER 27. SUPERFLUID AND COHERENT PROPERTIES OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CON
was formed. At even higher frequency, a symmetrical vortex lattice appeared in a
transverse plane (see Fig. 27.4). Finally, at rotation frequencies near the radial trap
frequency ωr , the condensate wavefunction became turbulent and finally disappeared.
As soon as the optical spoon was removed, the vortex lattice gradually decayed losing
the vortices one by one.

27.2.3

Solitons

Work on solitons has been done by [676, 652, 409, 653, 447, 519, 320, 457, 100, 30,
192, 96, 170].
27.2.3.1

Dark solitons

Solitons are non-singular solutions of any equation satisfying,
|ψ(r, t)| = |ψ(r − vt)| .

(27.22)

Solitons are well known to occur in non-linear optical media, for example in optical
fibers, when dispersion is counterbalanced by self-phase modulation, such that optical signals propagate without spreading. The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is another
example for a nonlinear wave equation supporting soliton-like solutions. States called
dark soliton or twisted state with a dynamically stable density dip are expected in
condensates with repulsive interactions [447, 519, 320, 457]. In contrast to topologically stable states, for example, vortices, dark solitons are pseudo-defects, the decay
of which, even though it may be slow, is topologically trivial. Due of the greater
freedom of movement of their wavefunctions, solitons can be distorted by complex deformations [100]. Soliton-like matter wave states were initially observed in superfluid
3
He-B [30]. In dilute gases, the size of the solitons is of the order of healing length.
The first dark solitons in dilute gases were created by applying an inhomogeneous
phase shift to a condensate [96, 170]. One half of the condensate was irradiated by a
far-detuned laser pulse (detuning ∆, Rabi frequency Ω, duration τ  ~/gn0 ) in order
to advance the phase of this part of the condensate by ϕ = Ω2 τ /4∆. When the phase
shift was set to π, an abrupt phase gradient developed at the boundary delimiting
the two halves. The condensate reacted to the phase gradient by developing a deep
density minimum all along the boundary corresponding to a soliton (see Fig. 27.5).
The phase distribution can also be imaged by interferometric techniques based on
Bragg diffraction (see Sec. 28.2). In one dimension, the density dip of the soliton
corresponds to a node of the dipolar topological mode [653, 447, 457].
The abrupt phase gradient at the boundary plane exerts a force trying to increase
the gap, while repulsive interactions work to heal it. At zero temperature, this balance
ensures the dynamic stability of the soliton. While a perfect dark soliton should be
stationary, experiments [96, 170] revealed that solitons with finite contrast propagate
along the direction of the plane’s normal vector with a velocity, which must always
be less than the local sound velocity,

where n is the peak density of the condensate and nsol the density at the bottom
of the dark soliton [519, 320]. Fig. 27.5 shows that the soliton develops a curvature

when it propagates. One reason for this is a slower sound velocity, cs = gn0 /m, on
the edges of the condensate, where the density is lower. The second reason is, that
the density in the dip, nsol , goes to zero at the edges. In the presence of a thermal
cloud, dissipation reduces the contrast of the density dip and accelerates the soliton,
until it reaches the sound velocity cs and finally disappears.

Bright solitons

In condensates with attractive interactions bright solitons have been observed, as well
[352, 340].

27.2.4.1

Creation of topological modes

One possibility of creating topological modes is to apply a temporal modulation to the
trapping potential [676]. The modulation frequency must be resonant with the energy
difference between the excited mode and the ground state. Another possibility is to
vary the interaction energy via a modulation of the scattering length in the vicinity
of a Feshbach resonance [138].
The steady-state situation of a cloud in a stationary trap is thermal equilibrium,
that is, inversion is not possible. At a time-dependent (e.g. shaking) potential however, for example, transitions to excited vibrational levels can be driven. These can
generate inversion, provided collision-induced relaxation is not too fast 3 .

27.2.5

Turbulence

The issue of turbulence is one of the most important problems of classical physics
yet to be solved [211]. In superfluids, restrictions imposed by quantum mechanics
constrain the emergence of turbulence, which is then called quantum turbulence. On
the other hand, the study of quantum turbulence can improve our understanding of
classical turbulence [187]. Recently, the study of the dynamics of a ensemble of vortices
in a Bose-Einstein condensate allowed the identification of signatures of quantum
turbulence [292, 276].

27.3

Atom optics

Unlike the photons [377], there is no doubt about the fact that atoms are particles.
On the other hand, the deep analogy between light and matter, resulting from the
particle-wave duality, prompted de Broglie in 1924 to ascribe a wave to each massive
particle, whose wavelength would be a function of the particle’s momentum. Whether
an atom behaves more like a particle or a wave depends on the specific experimental
situation. For example, interferometers emphasize its wave nature: Atoms are able
to interfere with themselves, when their Broglie wavelength is coherently split and
then recombined. (Bosonic) atoms are able to interfere with other atoms, if their de
Broglie wavelengths are greater than their distances. For this to happen, it requires
high densities and very low temperatures, that is, high phase space densities. When
the phase space densities are so high that the Broglie waves come into contact, effects
of quantum statistics begin to influence the dynamics of the atoms, and fermions will
behave differently from bosons.
Analogously to the distinction between classical and laser optics, we can separate
the area of conventional atomic optics working with individual, mutually incoherent
atoms, from the area of coherent atomic optics working with Bose-Einstein condensates. Unlike for the study of phenomena related to superfluidity, gases with weak
interatomic interactions are generally more useful for the study of the coherent properties of condensates and for application in atomic optics. Nevertheless, interatomic
collisions increase the complexity of the dynamics of matter waves interacting with
atom optical devices, by introducing non-linarities analogous to those known from
nonlinear optics and thus raising the field of nonlinear atom optics.

27.3.1

Atomic optical tools

The basic equipment of an atomic optics laboratory [436, 3, 490, 218, 506] comprises
atomic beams, atom traps, lenses and waveguides, various types of mirrors and resonators, Stern-Gerlach type matter wave polarizers, de Broglie wave phase shifters
based on Bragg diffraction, and a multitude of atomic beam gratings. Obviously,
gratings allow the construction of atom interferometers, which are used in experiments and high precision devices, for example, atomic gyroscopes and gravimeters.
Other applications for atomic beams controlled by atom optical elements are in atomic
holography for the projection of complex pattern into integrated semiconductor circuits [448], in lithography [620], and in microscopy [181].
An important feature of atoms (as compared to light) is the existence of a rich
internal structure providing a wealth of additional degrees of freedom, whose dynamics
(of the Bloch vector) is frequently entangled with the motional dynamics (of the
de Broglie wave). This allows to monitor (e.g. in matter wave interferometers) the
evolution of the motional state of the matter wave via an observation of the internal

968 CHAPTER 27. SUPERFLUID AND COHERENT PROPERTIES OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CON
excitation. Moreover, in some interferometers, the de Broglie wave is not even split,
and one does interferometry with completely immobile atoms or ions [308].
The epitome of a coherent light source is the laser, and we may ask whether there
is a material analogue, which would be a source of coherent matter [658, 84, 586, 303,
455, 357] serving for coherent atom optics. In fact, we may already consider a trapped
condensate as a stationary atom laser pulse with the trapping potential playing the
role of the laser resonator. While most atom optical devices (including conventional
atomic interferometers) do not require mutual coherence of atoms, certain applications
take advantage of an intense, highly directional, monochromatic, and coherent atom
source. In this respect, atom lasers are much superior to thermal atomic beams.
While a thermal beam contains about 10−12 atoms per mode and a magneto-optical
trap about 10−6 , a condensed mode may contain more than 106 atoms. Condensates
offer the advantage of large de Broglie wave amplitudes and de Broglie wavelengths as
long as their actual size (which can be much longer than optical wavelengths). And for
an atom laser, the coherence length can even be longer than that of the condensate
from which it emerged. This obviously has a major impact on the sensitivity and
resolution of atom optical elements, in particular those, where atomic coherence is
important, for example, atom interferometers. Without doubt atom lasers will replace
conventional atomic beams in precision measurement of fundamental constants and
tests of fundamental symmetries ([Phys. World (mar,97) p.43]). Finally, atom lasers
are crucial for nonlinear optics.
Also of interest are the references [585, 448, 512, 379, 531, 35, 291, 190, 505, 169,
300, 520, 319, 551, 59, 181, 646].

27.3.2

The atom laser

A large number of techniques for making an atom laser has already been developed
[422, 16, 427, 11, 71, 267, 404] and theories on atom lasers have been formulated
[265, 453, 657, 636, 309]. The following sections are devoted to explaining, why the
term atom laser is justified. For the reasoning we will let as guide by the optical laser.
We already mentioned the trapping potential (replacing the resonator in lasers)
as a major ingredients of an atom laser 4 . Another necessary feature would be the
availability of an output coupling mechanism, which we still need to discuss in the
following. Apart from these more practical aspects, we need to prove, that atom lasers
are indeed phase-coherent, and we have to clarify the role of bosonic stimulation and
of irreversibility in the production process of a BEC.
27.3.2.1

Bosonic stimulation and irreversibility

The gain mechanism for optical lasers is photonic stimulation of atoms inciting them
to emit other photons into the stimulating mode. The atomic laser operates in a
similar way. Atoms trapped in a potential constitute a thermal reservoir. Binary
collisions redistribute the atoms among the vibrational energy levels of the potential.
If a vibrational level already contains an atomic population, Bose-Einstein quantum
4 Coherent reflection of atom laser beams has been demonstrated [77, 18, ?], and an atom laser
cavity with efficient transverse focusing has been built [73]

27.3. ATOM OPTICS

statistics will encourage atoms involved in a collision process to join this level. Ultimately, this comes down to an irreversible pumping of a single level, where the atoms
accumulate to build a single degenerate quantum state. Bose condensation is always
the result of bosonic stimulation. However, the dynamics and time scale for the formation of a condensate have been controversially discussed, until some experiments
[427] could directly visualize in vivo the process of nucleation and the exponential
amplification at the center of a thermal cloud (see Fig. 27.7).

the growth of a condensate toward thermal equilibrium for different initial numbers
of condensed atoms.
The very high concentration of population in a single phase space cell during the
creation of a condensate represents a dramatic reduction of entropy. Since the total
entropy can not decrease, the condensate must be coupled to a thermal reservoir
receiving the excess entropy. This coupling is necessarily irreversible. In practice, the
reservoir is the cloud of thermal atoms, whose energy is spread over many vibrational
states. Irreversibility is introduced by collisions and the subsequent removal of the
hottest atoms.
27.3.2.2

Phase of a condensate and first and higher-order coherences

First-order coherence and long-range order are necessary conditions for assigning a
single global phase to the condensate. The existence of a single phase, and the possibility of measuring it, were questioned in the past. Certainly, the phase of a BEC is
not observable by itself, but only the relative phase of two condensates.
The intrinsic phase-coherence of condensates has demonstrated in many experiments. An early example [271] employed internal state interferometry by splitting and
remixing 87 Rb condensates trapped in the different Zeeman states |F, mF i = |1, −1i
and |2, 1i. They found that the phase was remembered for times longer than 150 ms.
In another experiment [13, 349, 636], illustrated in Fig. 27.8, a condensate was spatially split in two halves and then recombined. The interpenetration of the two halves
at a well-defined relative velocity gave rise to a clear matter wave interference pattern.
This ability of ballistically expanding condensates to interfere demonstrated the absence of a random phase lag during the expansion process and that the preservation
of the condensates’ long range order. However, under the repulsive influence of the
mean-field energy, the phase profile of a released condensate evolves in a non-uniform

970 CHAPTER 27. SUPERFLUID AND COHERENT PROPERTIES OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CON
but well-defined manner [574].
The homogeneity of the phase of a confined condensate was also confirmed experimentally [596, 266, 72] through interferometric techniques based on Bragg diffraction
(see Sec. 28.2.2). The spatial coherence of an output coupled atom laser has been
verified with a double-slit experiment [72]. And the temporal coherence of an atom
laser beam was shown to be Fourier-limited by the finite output coupling time [?].
Similar to Young’s double slit experiment in optics, the observation of matter
wave interference only indicates first-order coherence, i.e. amplitude fluctuations in
the matter field. Signatures for the presence of higher-order coherences in condensates were discovered in other experiments: The second-order correlation function,
which represents a measure for intensity fluctuations (number of particles) in the
matter field, was derived from measurements of the condensate’s release energy [351].
And the third-order coherence can be deduced from a comparison of the three-body
recombination rates for condensed and thermal clouds [99].

fringes.
A reliable characterization of atom number fluctuations and matter wave phase
fluctuations in condensates is important for the simple reason, that these fluctuations will limit ultimately the resolution of atom interferometers, analogous to the
Schawlow-Townes limit in lasers.
27.3.2.3

Output coupling

The output coupler for a trapped condensate plays a role similar to that of the partially
reflecting mirror of a laser resonator. It transfers a fraction of condensed atoms out
of the trapping potential through a coherent coupling to untrapped states. The coupling can be conveniently implemented via adiabatic potentials (see 19.1.3 and 24.4.3)
generated by radiation (e.g. radiofrequency pulses [422] or continuous radiofrequency
[71]). Also, pairs of laser beams in Raman configuration can create a coherent quasi-

27.3. ATOM OPTICS

971

continuous and well-collimated atomic beam [267] and tunneling can give rise to a
pulsed mode-locked atom laser (mode-locked laser) [11].
A trapped condensate represents a finite reservoir from which an atom laser can
be fed. For a really cw atom laser, an incoherent pumping mechanism, continuously
feeding the BEC, while it delivers atoms to the atom laser, is still lacking [398].

in Munich in 1999, at Yale in 1998, and at NIST in 1999. The vertical sizes of the images
are, from left to right: 5, 2, 0.5, and 1 mm.

27.3.3

Atomic interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates

The most obvious use of an atom laser is within an atomic interferometer [597, 588,
78, 266, 72, 574, 351, 99, 477, 167, 434, 450]. Many types of interferometers have
been developed over the years. First of all, we note that the interferometric idea
can be realized in the spatial domain (e.g. an atomic beam passing through a light
wave) or in the time domain (e.g. a trapped atomic cloud or an immobile trapped ion
irradiated by a pulsed light) [83, 308, ?, 235].
Furthermore, depending on the involved degree of freedom (kinetic or internal
excitation), we may distinguish two types of interferometers. Matter wave interferometers operating with the kinetic degree of freedom often use beam splitters based on
Bragg diffraction [365, 477, 266, 574]. Matter wave interferometers involving internal
degrees of freedom generally couple two species of condensates, that is, two condensates in different states of internal excitation, for example, in different Zeeman [598],
hyperfine [458, 271, 434], or dressed states [?]. The phases of two BECs in different
internal states, which we will call |±i, evolve according to their respective chemical

972 CHAPTER 27. SUPERFLUID AND COHERENT PROPERTIES OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CON
potentials, ϕ|±i (t) = µ|±i t. The accumulated phases are not directly observable, but
their difference, ∆ϕ(t), can be measured by Ramsey interferometry.

27.3.4

Non-linear atomic optics

In classical nonlinear optics, the interaction between matter (e.g. dilute gases) and
light is described by Maxwell’s equations. The electromagnetic field E creates a
macroscopic polarization,
P(r, t) = χ(E)E(r, t) = χ(1) · E + χ(3) : EEE + ... .

(27.28)

which in turn acts back onto the field. Higher-order processes, such as self-focusing,
second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, etc. are described by the non-linear
susceptibility χ(3) . These processes require the presence of a non-linear medium (the
vacuum polarization itself being too small [341, 257]).
The role of binary collisions in coherent matter wave optics, as described by the
nonlinear term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (26.21), is very similar to the role of
the third-order nonlinear susceptibility in quantum optics [382, 365, 168, 240, 621,
342, 278, 343, 384, 145, 280]. For example, if the atomic interaction is repulsive,
the nonlinear term tries to increase the size of the condensate as much as possible
within the limits imposed by the trapping potential. This behavior is analogous to
the phenomenon of self-defocusing known in non-linear optics.
Small-amplitude elementary oscillations are well described by the Bogolubov-de
Gennes equations, which are a linearized version of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
[134]. On the other hand, large-amplitude oscillations, which are sensitive to the
nonlinear mean-field interaction [582], showed a splitting of the frequency for quasiparticle excitation, in analogy with the generation of the second-harmonic (SHG) in
quantum optics [280].
Other phenomena, such as matter wave phase conjugation and four waves mixing
(4WM) [240] have been observed in experiments [168]. The three matter wave modes
for the nonlinear mixing were produced out of a single condensate by applying two
short consecutive sequences of Bragg diffraction pulses. The condensates are created
in the same spatial region, but at different times. The nonlinear mixing during the
process of spatial separation was observed by time-of-flight images.
The geometry of the laser beams is shown in Fig. 27.10(a) in the laboratory system.
A first standing wave light pulse is generated by lasers k1 and k2 detuned from each
other by an amount, such that the Bragg condition is satisfied and the momentum
p2 = ~k1 − ~k2 is transmitted to the diffracted atoms. Then, a second standing
wave light pulse formed by lasers k1 and k3 = −k1 transmits to the diffracted atoms
the momentum p3 = 2~k1 . The duration and intensity of the standing waves are
adjusted such as to create an approximately equal distribution of Nj0 atoms in all three
condensate momentum modes, each mode having a different momentum, p1 = 0, p2 ,
and p3 . Initially, the three wavepackets ψ̂j ≡ ψ̂0 (r)eipj r/~ overlap. The nonlinear
term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation mixes the wavepackets while they separate to

27.3. ATOM OPTICS

p4 = −pj + pm + pn

p24 = −p2j + p2m + p2n .

To produce the new momenta, p4 6= p1 , p2 , p3 , the corresponding wavepackets must
gather atoms from all three initial packets p1 6= p2 6= p3 .
The experimental observation of a newly emerging wavepacket ψ̂4 has two complementary interpretations: In the inertial system defined by p1 = −p3 [see Fig. 27.10(b)],
the wavepackets ψ̂1 and ψ̂3 suffer elastic collisions. The direction in which the condensates are scattered is, a priori, isotropic. The injection of a third condensate
ψ̂2 bosonically stimulates the formation of a forth one, ψ̂4 , in a predefined direction
p4 = −p2 . The laws of conservation for the particle numbers, momenta, and energies (27.29) only allow processes, which can be interpreted as degenerate 4WM in this
inertial system. Each of the wavepackets ψ̂1 and ψ̂3 sacrifice N4 atoms to create a
new wavepacket ψ̂4 and to amplify the wavepacket ψ̂2 . The redistribution of atoms
is a coherent process.

Figure 27.10: Matter wave 4WM can be illustrated (a) in the laboratory system, or (b) in
the inertial system defined by p1 = −p3 , or (c) in the system defined by p1 = −p2 . In each
system the process has a different physical interpretation (see text). The right image shows
the experimental result.

The second interpretation becomes clear in the inertial system, in which p1 =
−p2 [see Fig. 27.10(c)]. The conservation of energy only allows scattering products
satisfying p4 = p3 , that is, ψ̂1+ ψ̂2 ψ̂3 and ψ̂2+ ψ̂1 ψ̂3 . In this system, the process can
be interpreted as Bragg diffraction of the wavepacket ψ̂3 by the matter wave lattice
formed by ψ̂1 and ψ̂2 . The wavepacket ψ̂4 is nothing more than the first diffraction
order. Unlike the Bragg diffraction in an optical lattice (see Sec. 28.2), the Bragg
diffraction by a matter wave lattice requires nonlinear mixing through binary atomic
collisions. Thus, the number of redistributed atoms depends on parameters such as
the interatomic interaction strength, the size of the condensate, and the collision time
between the wavepackets, i.e. the time that the wavepackets spend together before
separating.
Despite the similarity with the optical counterpart, matter wave 4WM is fundamentally different: The number of particles must be conserved and the energymomentum dispersion relation is not linear. Furthermore, while photons require the

presence of a nonlinear medium in order to participate in higher-order processes,
atomic matter waves mix through binary collisions.

Quantum atom optics

When describing a condensate by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we specify a phase
and an atom number. However, both are conjugate quantities, which can not be
specified without uncertainty. So, what does the BEC really look like: a Glauber
state or rather a Fock state? We need to be careful. Certainly, it makes no sense
talking about the absolute phase of a single BEC. Only the relative phase between two
BECs matters. The condition for interference is, that we do not know, from which
condensate the interfering atom came ∆N ∆ϕ ≥ 1. So, the relative atom number
must be uncertain.

27.4.1

Quantum transport

Now, let us imagine two BECs in a double-well potential. Atoms may be move
between the wells via Josephson tunneling, even if the height of the barrier is higher
than the atomic energy. Hence, the motion is a type of quantum transport. Be

This shows that the current oscillates in time. This feature is well-known for Josephson junction in superconductors.
The question is now, what will be the steady-state of the two BECs [474]. Experiments have shown, that the BECs will gradually evolve into a superposition of
number states, until they are coherent. The time scale is set by Josephson tunneling.
The same interference pattern would result from BECs initially having well-defined
phases 5,6
5 Also, a spin-squeezed state i.e. a state with sub-Poissonian number statistics approaching pure
number states have been compared to coherent states. Superposition of the first ones exhibited no
interference while superposition of the second ones lead to observable interference.

Optical lattices and the Mott insulator

We have already pointed out in Sec. 24.3.2, that laser beams tuned far away from
resonances serve to construct trapping potentials for atoms. Laser beams incident
on the atomic cloud under various angles allow the engineering of a large diversity
of geometries for attractive potentials (with red tuned lasers) or repulsive potentials
(with blue tuned lasers). Various cooling methods can be combined with dipolar
traps, for example, Doppler cooling [311], Raman cooling [272], evaporative cooling
[2], or gravitational Sisyphus cooling [463]. A particularly interesting geometry is that
of are optical lattice, which we will discuss in the following sections.
27.4.2.1

Bragg scattering from optical lattices

In solid state physics the structure of crystal is studied by Bragg or von Laue scattering
with X-ray radiation. Similar techniques can be used in optical lattices [64, 552, 641,
642, 578]. Under certain conditions, we can even expect to open a photonic band gap
[17, 172, 553], which draws an analogy between optical lattices and photonic crystal.
A great advantage of optical lattices is the possibility of directly visualizing the
momentum distribution of the confined atoms, that is, the distribution of atoms over
the Brillouin zone.
27.4.2.2

Bloch bands and Bloch oscillations

The Bloch model plays a very important role in solid state theory and can be applied
to describe the dynamics of atoms in optical lattices (see Chp. 5.4). To learn about
Landau-Zener tunneling and Wannier ladders consult [261, 662].
Atoms in optical lattices subject to an accelerating force (e.g. gravitation mg), can
execute Bloch oscillationsBloch oscillation. This phenomenon was originally expected
to occur with electrons in solid state crystals accelerated by an electric force −eE,
but there it is very difficult to observe, due to electron scattering at lattice defects.
It has, finally, been observed in semiconductor superlattices, in ultra-thin Josephson
junctions, and with cold atoms in optical lattices [275, 405].

27.4.2.4

The Mott insulator

In the Mott insulating state, the atoms are localized at individual sites of an optical
lattice. On one hand, the localization impedes any phase relation between atoms at
different sites, that is, at a given site the phase uncertainty ∆φ is complete. But at
the same time, there is a perfect correlation of the atom number at each site known
as spin squeezing 7 , because (in a homogeneous lattice) every site contains exactly the
same number of atoms, that is, the atom number uncertainty ∆N tends to zero. At
a given lattice site, the number of atoms and the phase of the wavefunction can not
be simultaneously fixed: ∆N ∆φ > 1.
The absence of relative coherence between different sites and of the ability to
interfere prohibits the description of the system by a single global wavefunction and
the use of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Nevertheless, the Mott insulating state is
not equivalent to a completely randomized sample. On the contrary, the coherence
only changes its character 8 .
The Mott transition of a condensate from a superfluid state and to state of a Mott
insulator occurs as a quantum phase transition, because it is driven by quantum fluctuations rather than of thermal noise. Therefore, it is a direct result of Heisenberg’s
uncertainty relation.
7 The

spin squeezing feature makes the Mott insulator interesting for spectroscopy at the Heisenberg limit and for quantum computation.
8 Remember, that the Fock state is a complicated superposition of Glauber states. The disappearance and reappearance of coherence is reminiscent to the phenomenon of collapse and revival in
the Jaynes-Cummings model.

The Bose-Hubbard model

The Bose-Hubbard model gives an approximate description of the physics of interacting
bosons in a lattice. The model is closely related to the fermionic Hubbard model, used
in solid state physics for the description of superconducting systems and the hopping
of electrons between the atoms of a solid crystalline lattice.
The Bose-Hubbard model starts from the following Hamiltonian [474, 247],

the moment a homogeneous condensate.
The Hilbert space dimension of the Bose-Hubbard model grows exponentially with
the number of atoms N and the number of sites L,

Db =

(Nb + L + 1)!
.
Nb !(L − 1)!

(27.49)

For the Fermi-Hubbard model, the Pauli exclusion principle leads to the Hilbert space
dimension,
 
L
Df =

(27.50)
Nf
In three dimensional lattices the Hilbert space grows even faster. Therefore, it is a
difficult computational task to model or simulate such systems, and generally not
possible fro more than 20 atoms and 20 lattice sites.
At zero temperature, the Bose-Hubbard model (in the absence of disorder) predicts
the atomic ensemble to be an a Mott insulating state (MI) when J  U , a superfluid
state (SF) when J  U , or a supersolid phase (SS), where both solid and superfluid
phases (diagonal and off-diagonal) coexist. Mott insulation phases are characterized
by integer site occupation numbers, by the existence of an energy gap for particlehole excitations, and zero compressibility. In the presence of disorder, a third phase,
the Bose glass exists. This phase is insulation because of the Anderson localization
effects. Bose glass is characterized by a finite compressibility, the absence of a gap,
and an infinite superfluid susceptibility [?]. See also (watch talk).

Schrödinger cats

Ruostekoski et al. [530] proposed a double BEC system consisting of two momentum sidemodes and a far-off resonance laser beam that constantly spontaneously
redistributes the atoms between the sidemodes. Homodyne detection of the scattered
photons established relative phase information in such a way, that the relative number
information is blurred in such a way that both sidemodes evolve into a simultaneous
superposition of phase and number states. They disregard thermal excitations and
two-body collisions. The cats are very sensitive to decoherence.
Cirac et al. [118] and Gordon et al. [?] consider Josephson double species condensates. The relative atom numbers Rabi flop. Mediated by the mean-field the systems
may evolve into cats. The proposals have been reexamined by Dalvit et al. [150].
Other contributions come from [239], [298], [536], [513], [323]. First experiments on
spin-squeezed states have been made by [474].

Interaction of Bose-Einstein
condensates with light
Light can essentially be used in two ways for the manipulation of matter waves:
1. Tuned far from resonance, light serves to create conservative optical dipole potentials (see Secs. 24.3.2 and 27.4.2). In such circumstances the states of internal atomic
excitation can be adiabatically eliminated from the description of the center-of-mass
dynamics. 2. Close to resonance the situation is quite different, but even then, the
coherent excitation of internal states may allow for a controlled manipulation of the
atomic motion. Among the examples discussed in the following sections are the adiabatic sweeps, the Raman output coupler, Bragg pulses, photoassociation, and matter
wave superradiance (see Fig. 28.1).

Figure 28.1: Different types of coherent coupling: (a) coherent coupling of hyperfine levels,
(b) coupling from a confined state to the continuum of free states, (c) mutual coupling of
different velocity states of an atom, and (d) coupling between a (collisional) state of two free
atoms with a bound molecular state.

Scattering of light by degenerate gases

28.1.1

The structure factor for degenerate quantum gases

We introduced in Sec. 20.1.1 the notion of the structure factor, where it was used to
characterize the scattering of light by thermal distributions of atoms. To characterize
the scattering of matter waves, we must generalize the notion of the structure factor.
We wrote in (20.3) the Fourier transform of the density distribution, which now

Hence, ρ̂† (q) describes the scattering of an atom with the momentum k to k + q. We
also find,

(28.5)

as a generalization of the classical structure factor. The static structure factor describes the probability to excite a condensate by creating a quasi-particle with momentum k. We will need these notions in the Sec. 28.2.4. R
The dynamic structure factor is obtained from S(q) = S(q, ω)dω and measures
the density of correlations in the ground state with 0 momentum. The formula describes, how an atom probes its environment by scattering quasi-particles back and

The Hamiltonian of the Rayleigh scattering process

In Sec. 2.5.2 we saw the Galilei-boost (2.189),
|k + qi = eıq·r̂ |ki .

(28.8)

28.1. SCATTERING OF LIGHT BY DEGENERATE GASES

985

In the second quantization we generalize to,
Z
|k + qi = ψ̂ † (r)eıq·r ψ̂(r)d3 r|ki = ρ̂† (q)|ki .

(28.9)

Thus, we can implement the second quantization by simply replacing eıq·r by ρ̂† (q).
Now, the Hamiltonian for the process of a photon absorption from the mode ĉki ,
taking into account the photonic recoil, was introduced in (19.6),
Ĥint = ~Ω(r̂)e−ıki ·r̂ ĉki σ̂ + + c.c. .

(28.10)

If the process is followed by the reemission of a photon to the mode ĉkf ,
Ĥint = ~Ω(r̂)eı(kf −ki )·r ĉ†kf ĉki .

scattering process as a process of four wave mixing (4WM) [349, 589]. The light and
the atoms are treated on equal footings as modes which can receive (quasi-)particle
populations, and the scattering corresponds to a redistribution of populations between
the modes 3 .
The Hamiltonian (28.13) can be applied to various situations, such as spontaneous
or stimulated Rayleigh scattering or Bragg scattering, depending on which ones of the
modes kf , ki , pf , and pi are populated or filtered by imposed boundary conditions.
Using momentum conservation q ≡ kf − pi = −pf + pi , we obtain the cross

Bosonic stimulation

We assume in the following weak light intensities (and hence a negligible contribution
of the Mollow fluorescence spectrum). That is, without cooperative effects the light
would be elastically scattered by Rayleigh scattering. Now, we adopt a notation
labeling the multimodal state by the numbers of photons and atoms distributed over
the available light and momentum modes. That is, the initial state consists of np
atoms distributed over momentum atomic states p and Nk photons distributed over
wave vector modes k denoted by |...Nk ...irad ⊗ |...np ...iat :

28.1.3.1

Elastic and inelastic scattering

The interpretation of the result is the following: Light can be scattered in two ways:
(i) with or (ii) without change of atomic moment distribution. The event of a photon
scattering (28.19) then it consists of two terms (28.24) and (28.27) [495],

(28.28)

The first term of (28.28) occurs when the momentum of the scattering atom does
not change, p = q, that is, when the populations of the momentum states np and nq
do not change. The corresponding term (28.27) describes elastic Rayleigh scattering.
This process is coherent, that is, the phase relationship between the incident wave
and the outgoing wave is fixed, because the photon emission is self-stimulated. I.e. it
decays to the original mode via forward scattering within the angle defined by the
phase matching condition ϑ < λ/d, where d is the size of the atomic sample [349].
This contribution is dispersive, reversible, and conservative, and it is at the origin of
the dipole force.
The second term of (28.28) is the inelastic part of Rayleigh scattering, where an
atom with the initial momentum np is scattered to the momentum state nq . This
term is absorptive, dissipative, and spontaneous. The frequency of the photons is
shifted, a momentum is imparted to the atom, such that the process is incoherent.
Hence, a suggestive way of expressing the differential scattering cross-section (28.19)
is,

The bosonic stimulation of inelastic Rayleigh scattering represents a way to overcome, on one hand the restrictive phase matching condition, and on the other the
incoherence of the scattering into large angles. For non-interacting systems of localized bosons S(q, ω) can be expressed using single particle states |ii with energy Ei

Playing with bosonic and fermionic states

Here, we want to address the question, whether scattering processes are influenced
by bosonic stimulation or cooperative enhancement. Let us consider the case of N
atoms (bosons or fermions) generated from vacuum by operators â†m (q)|0i, where m

indicates some additional quantum number (for example, the vibrational state of a
loose trapping potential) helping us to enumerate fermionic states, and q indicates
the momentum (considered independent from the trapping potential for short enough
times). The operators respect the rules,
[âm (0), ân (q)]∓ = 0 = [â†m (0), â†n (q)]∓
[âm (0), â†n (q)]∓

and

and

where upper signs hold for bosons and lower signs for fermions. Initially the N atoms

Bosonic stimulation versus cooperative enhancement by a Bragg

Now, we scatter a photon, whose fate is not of interest here, but which triggers
possible transitions of an atom sitting together with N1 atoms in the momentum

This means that, if k = 0 or k = q, the scattering is subject to cooperative enhancement by a factor of N/2 (which is the number of atoms in each of the momentum state
0 and q) independently on the quantum nature of the atom (boson or fermion). That
is, the probability that the scattered atoms joins one of the two momentum goes, for
large N , like N 2 , but for N = 1 there is no enhancement possible. Do Exc. 28.1.6.11.
28.1.4.2

Interpretation of bosonic stimulation as cooperative enhancement

The distinction between spontaneous and stimulated processes is not always obvious,
as there is a whole world of cooperative processes in between those two concepts, for
instance, superradiance, Bragg scattering, and enhanced spontaneous emission into
a resonant cavity. All those processes have in common that they are amplified by
fluctuations.
Example 111 (Stimulated emission versus spontaneous emission: Cooperativity in a cavity ): Let us first discuss the case of a cavity. Vacuum
fluctuations (VF) are structured by a cavity (finesse F ) leading to a modified
DOS becoming anisotropic and developing spectral resonances. In resonance
the VFs are enhanced (we get a standing wave of VFs), while off resonance they
are suppressed. Therefore, an excited atom placed inside a cavity will suffer
’spontaneous stimulation’ to decay into the cavity mode. Alternatively, we may
say that the atom not only reacts to the local VFs but to all VFs reflected F
times by the cavity mirrors provided these VFs are in phase (which is the case
when the cavity is resonant). That is, cavity-enhanced VFs amplify scattering
into cavity modes and, as we argued in Sec. 21.1.4 the VFs are measured by the
structure factor (21.41).
Note, that the presence of photons in the cavity does not stimulate ’additionally’,
because stimulated emission and absorption are reversible processes.
Example 112 (Bragg scattering: Cooperativity in a lattice):

992 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT

Figure 28.3: Cartoon of cooperative enhancement in a cavity.
Example 113 (Matter wave superradiance and CARL: Cooperativity
in a BEC ): We have seen that the stimulated processes mentioned above do
not rely on quantum statistics, but rather on symmetry and coherence. Let us
start with a naive picture of bosonic stimulation, a concept which can be applied to matter waves [350]. The physical process behind bosonically stimulated
scattering is, that the presence of a macroscopically occupied state increases
the density fluctuations of the system, and bosonically enhanced scattering is
simply the diffraction of particles from these density fluctuations measured by
S(q, ω).

28.1.5

Collective scattering for condensates with interactions

Until now we totally disregarded interactions between particles. Correlations are introduced in a BEC by interactions between the atoms. Therefore, collective scattering
effects are influenced by interactions, while on the other hand an ideal gas (gn → 0)
scatters like an ultra-cool non-degenerate thermal cloud. In this sense, particle-like
excitations (p2 /2m  gn) in an interacting BEC behave like thermal atoms. The
mean-field energy can be seen as resulting from excitations of phonon pairs. These
pairwise excitations populate the momentum modes, which modify the scattering of
light via bosonic stimulation. That is, an interacting condensate (gn > 0) gives a collective response to an incident light beam. Note that µ > 0 is possible when V (r) 6= 0
and gn 6= 0 even if T → 0, which is the case here considered.
What is the nature of the collective behavior? 1. The Bogolubov spectrum is
modified. In the phononic regime, the absence of dispersion allows the definition of a
speed of sound. 2. The scattering of light can be suppressed by excitation of phonon
pairs. This effect is anisotropic and more pronounced in forward direction. That is,
the resonance at which the light is scattered is shifted and broadened. The latter
effect is understood via destructive interference of two processes: Scattering from a
BEC to the momentum mode k and from the momentum mode −k to a BEC.
It is important to be aware that the notion of bosonic stimulation ∼ ni (1+nf ) and
fermionic inhibition ∼ ni (1 − nf ) also has its limitations, when interatomic interactions are not negligible, that is, when the quantum depletion is remarkable [242, 413].
The effect of interatomic collisions can be taken into account as contributions of pair
correlations to the ground state of the BEC,

mode k. The populated recoil modes result in a increase of spontaneous emission by
a factor of vk2 = 1 + u2k . We can also understand the modification of the scattering
rate as resulting from small scale inhomogeneities generated by pair correlations. The
effect is strongest at small scattering angles, that is in forward direction.

factor is,
S(q, ω) = S87,87 (q, ω) + S6,6 (q, ω) + S6,87 (q, ω) + S87,6 (q, ω) .
Exciting the Bragg resonance for Li, the Rb cloud would stay unaffected,the such that

CARL amplification comes from cooperativity not from bosonic stimulation [445, 350,
556], that is, it should work for fermions and boltzons. To demonstrate this proceed
as follows:
a. Set up the single-atom Hamiltonian for a 3D harmonic potential in which the atoms
(bosons or fermions) are initially placed allowing for the possibility of momentum recoil by photon scattering. This disregards the trap’s inhomogeneity, but is a good
assumption for short times. What are the eigenfunction of this Hamiltonian? Calculate the expectation value for the density distribution. Express the field operators in
momentum space. Express the lowest energy states for a bosonic/fermionic cloud in
momentum representation.
b. Now apply a π/2-Bragg-pulse imparting the recoil K to the cloud. What is the
resulting state? Recalculate the expectation value for the density distribution.
c. Now, assume the presence of another free (test) atom (or photon). Write down the
Hamiltonian and the wavefunction for this atom. It is supposed to interact with the
atomic cloud via the (perturbatively treated) interaction potential,
Z
V̂ = λ d3 rψ̂1† (r)ψ̂2† (r)ψ̂2 (r)ψ̂1 (r) .
Calculate the probability that the atom is scattered at a particular wavevector, i.e. determine the cooperative enhancement factor.

e. How about cooperative enhancement in a cavity, when cooperativity is ensured by
a single atom plus all its mirror images?

Bragg diffraction

An important technique for manipulating the atomic motion is by Bragg diffraction 5 .
It allows the coherent transfer of atoms to other states of motion or to superpositions
of motional states, and is extremely useful for applications, such as the realization of
5 The idea is analogous to the manipulation of the k-vector of light waves by acousto-optic modulators.

996 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT
matter wave beamsplitters [365] and atomic lasers, or for the targeted excitation of
quasi-particles [365, 596, 588].
To implement Bragg diffraction, we consider two laser pulses with different frequencies and propagation directions ω, kω and ω − ∆ω, kω−∆ω , detuned from an
atomic resonance and intersecting at the position of atoms under an angle ϑ, as
shown in Fig. 28.4(a). The superposition of the electric fields of the light beams,

|E|2 = 4E02 cos2 q·r−∆ωt
= 2E02 [1 + cos(q · r − ∆ωt) ,
(28.52)

with which the atoms interact.
The Bragg diffraction technique has proven extremely efficient: up to 100% of
the atoms can be transferred to well-defined momentum sidemodes. In general, the
components of a cloud with different momentum modes overlap during the time scale
of the Bragg pulses. They only separate spatially after a ballistic flight time, which
then allows their identification via absorption imaging.

pulses of two laser beams in Raman configuration enclosing an angle of ϑ and detuned from
each other by ∆ω are simultaneously irradiated into the cloud. (b) Bogolubov dispersion

28.2.1

Interpretations of the Bragg diffraction process

Bragg’s diffraction can be treated within the formalism developed in Sec. 28.1.2, as
will be shown later, in Sec. 28.2.4. But before that, let us present a simplified approach
and several simple pictures illustrating the dynamics of Bragg diffraction.
28.2.1.1

Bragg diffraction picture

The first interpretation of this phenomenon is as matter wave Bragg diffraction at a
standing light wave (i.e. an one-dimensional optical lattice) formed by two crossing

28.2. BRAGG DIFFRACTION

pulsed laser beams 6 . We consider atoms initially at rest exposed to the standing
wave (28.51) with ∆ω = 0 and q ≡ qêz , such that the dipolar potential U ∝ |E|2 is,
with (28.52),
(28.53)
U (z) = U0 cos2 qz
2 .
Assuming a given finite interaction time τ , the modulation of the local phase of the
atoms becomes 7 ,

(28.54)
where Jn are the Bessel functions of the first kind 8 .
The condensed wavefunction evolves into a superposition of motional modes, which
correspond to the diffraction orders of Bragg scattering and their amplitudes through
the Bessel functions Jn . The diffraction efficiency increases with laser intensity and
with time.
Now, we need to generalize this result to the propagating standing wave of the
expression (28.52). The intensity generates a dipole potential,
U (z, t) ≈ U0 cos2

28.2.1.2

Compton scattering picture

The second interpretation is that of Compton scattering: Spontaneous Rayleigh scattering of a photon from a mode kω into a solid angle around kω−∆ω leaves an atom
with the recoil momentum ~q ≡ pf · pi . Of course, one can stimulate the Rayleigh
scattering process by providing the laser mode kω − ∆ω at the entrance. By replacing
the spontaneous output mode with a stimulated input mode, we increase the probability for an atomic recoil in the momentum mode ~q, which is thus pre-selected by
the choice of kω−∆ω . Since the elementary scattering process must conserve energy
and total momentum,

(28.59)
The efficiency for transferring atoms to the recoil mode depends on the fulfillment
of this condition. The Bragg condition can be employed to select higher diffraction
orders.
28.2.1.3

Stimulated Raman scattering picture

A third interpretation is as stimulated Raman scattering between two different kinetic
states of the atom [see 28.4(b)]. In fact, the momentum modes pi and pf have different
energies, which, for a condensate, are determined by the Bogolubov spectrum [236].
By varying the angle ϑ in the Bragg condition (28.58), we can choose the amount
of energy to be transferred and thus probe the spectrum, i.e. measure the excitation
energy E(q, µ) as a function of the momentum q and the chemical potential µ in the
particle regime q2 /2m  µ, as well as in the phonon regime q2 /2m  µ. On the other
hand, varying the detuning ∆ω in the Bragg condition (28.58), we selectively address
different velocity classes of a gas or condensate, which allows us to probe its velocity
distribution. This procedure is called spectroscopy of recoil-induced resonances (RIR)
[139, 596]. RIR spectroscopy also provides detailed information on the mean-field
energy and the (inhomogeneous) density distribution of a condensate. Note, finally,
that Bragg scattering is closely related to Kapitza-Dirac scattering of atomic beams,
well-known in conventional atom optics [339, 243].

assume pi = 0. (b) Experiment showing coherent splitting by a Bragg pulse.

28.2.1.4

Coherent splitting

There is a general interest in the possibility of dividing phase space by coherent coupling of otherwise independent modes. We are talking, of course, about double slits or
beamsplitters, which represent an essential tool of quantum mechanics. Bragg diffraction realizes a beamsplitter for atomic clouds analogous to the optical beamsplitter.
In fact, Bragg diffraction has been used for the realization of output couplers for atom
lasers and for atom interferometers. A suggestion that is sometimes made is the following: ’A condensate is a macroscopically populated momentum mode. The Bragg
beamsplitter divides the phase space into two entangled output modes. Shouldn’t it

28.2. BRAGG DIFFRACTION

999

be possible to generate a macroscopic superposition of two condensates, i.e. a really
macroscopic Schrödinger cat?’. Their is an obvious fundamental interest to study
such states and the mechanisms leading to their decoherence (see Sec. 16.1.1).
To clarify the situation, we first have to say, what we mean by Schrödinger cat.
A Schrödinger cat is a quantum superposition of many-body states. A perfect cat
made of N two-level atoms can be expressed as | + +...i ± | − −...i. The EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen (EPR) and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states (GHz) belong to
this category. The degree of entanglement of the cat is measured by the information
entropy defined as S = −hlog2 ρ̂i, where ρ̂ is the density operator. The information
entropy measures the amount of classical information that can be encoded in the
quantum state. For example, the entropy of a perfect cat state is S = 1 bit, because
if we find one of the atoms in the state |+i, we know that all others are in the same
state.
Second, we have to explain, what we mean by a beamsplitter. Subject to a beam
splitting process, every individual atom has the choice between one of two output
ports. However, if the process is coherent, every atom will evolve into a coherent
superposition, but it does so independently from the other atoms. That is, we can
write the state of the atomic cloud as a product state of Schrödinger kittens (|+i ±
|−i)N , but no real cat. The information entropy is S = N bit, as for independent
atoms. Nevertheless, the beamsplitter creates a certain correlation between the two
modes (see Sec.15.6).

Figure 28.6: Bragg interferometer.

How can it be, that a condensate composed of totally delocalized atoms, subject to
the homogeneous light fields of the Bragg pulse (the photons being totally delocalized

1000 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT
over the field mode), which interact with the condensate in a coherent way, increase
its entropy from 1 to N bits? At this point, it is useful to remember that, even in
condensates, the photons are scattered by individual atoms. The interaction with the
light localizes one atom in the condensate before removing it from there by recoil 9 .

28.2.2

Bragg interferometry of a thermal gas

Even above the critical temperature the momentum distribution of a dilute thermal gas is (slightly) modified by quantum statistics, i.e. by the classical, bosonic or
fermionic nature of the gas. The momentum distributions have been calculated in
Chp. 25.3. We have already emphasized that Bragg interferometry can be used to
measure the momentum distribution of a gas via RIR spectroscopy, whether the gas
is condensed or thermal. Now, let us discuss Bragg interferometry on a thermal gas,
based on the articles [407]DOI and [160]DOI .

As illustrated in Fig. 28.7, for T  Trec the atomic cloud occupies many momentum states, such that the Bragg scattering produces a RIR-like signal, that is,
the scattering probability is proportional to the population difference of the initial
and final momentum states, as discussed in Sec. 22.3.1. The number of scattered

28.2.2.1

Bragg scattering by free particles

Based on the interpretation of Bragg scattering as a Raman transition between two
momentum states, we can use the same model as in Secs. 28.4 to describe the process quantitatively [65, 407, 160]. We assume that during the Bragg pulse only two
discrete atomic momentum states j = 0, 1 are coupled, and that the impact of the
trapping potential can be neglected. This is justified for Bragg pulse sequences much
shorter than an oscillation period of the trap. The probability amplitudes for the
two momentum states are denoted by aj,kz . They correspond to atoms with initial
momenta ~kz that are coupled to states with momentum ~kz0 = ~(kz + 2q). The
temporal evolution of the amplitudes under the action of the Bragg light is given by
the solutions of the Schrödinger equation [407]DOI , [160]DOI ,

Concatenating temporal evolutions described by e−ıĤτ t/~ and e−ıĤ∆t t/~ , the phase
evolution of individual atoms in momentum state superpositions can be calculated
for arbitrary sequences of pulses separated by intervals of free evolution, for example,
Ramsey-type sequences.
If the atoms initially form a thermal cloud, they will be distributed according to
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, such that,
φ(kz ) = ~/(2πmkB T )1/2 e−~

2 2

.

(28.68)

To obtain the atomic momentum distribution after the application of a pulse sequence,
we calculate the evolution of the amplitudes aj,kz for a variety of initial momenta and
weigh the final populations of the momentum states with the distribution function
φ(kz ). The number of atoms expected in the zeroth and first Bragg diffraction order
is, therefore,
Z
Nj (t) = φ(kz )|aj,kz (t)|2 dkz .
(28.69)

The procedure neglects interatomic interactions, which is always a good presumption
for an ultracold Fermi gas [162].
28.2.2.2

Bragg scattering by trapped particles

When trapped atoms are considered, the problem arises that the Hilbert space of momentum states is simultaneously coupled by two interactions: a moving optical lattice
(generated by the Bragg lasers) and the (harmonic) trap. However, the situation gets
simpler if a separation of the scales is possible. In general, the duration of a pulse
is very short, τ  2π/ωz . In contrast, the duration of a free evolution period ∆t
(e.g. in a Ramsey cycle) may be such, that it is no more negligible compared to a trap
oscillation period, so that we need to account for the action of the trapping potential
explicitly.
As the trap couples the atomic momenta with the atomic positions (Ekin + Epot =
const), the initial spatial distribution of the atoms must now be considered. For
simplicity, we describe it as a thermal Gaussian, similarly to what has been done in
Eq. (28.68) for the momentum distribution,
1/2 −mω2 z2 /2kB T
z
ψ(z) = mωz2 /2πkB T
e
.
(28.70)
Beginning with the positions z and initial momenta kz , after a diffraction pulse transferring the recoil 2q to part of the atoms and being short enough not to change their
positions, the atoms follow classical trajectories. The atomic momenta (now depending on time) are,
~ωz

(28.71)

28.2. BRAGG DIFFRACTION

1003

where the first expression holds for non-diffracted atoms and the second for diffracted
atoms. These momenta are substituted for kz and kz0 , respectively, in the Hamiltonians (28.66) and (28.67). As the Bragg pulses are short compared to the oscillation
period, τ  2π/ωz , the effect of the trapping potential may be neglected during
Bragg scattering. This means that the Hamiltonian Ĥτ depends on k̃z (t), but can be
treated as time-independent for the short intervals τ . In contrast, the Hamiltonian
for free propagation Ĥ∆t depends on the time, if ∆t is long. In this case, the phase
evolution of the atoms in both coupled states can be described by the time evolution
operator as,

Since the amplitudes aj,z,kz now also depend on the initial atomic positions, the

28.2.3

Kapitza-Dirac scattering

An atomic beam with longitudinal de Broglie wavelength λdB = h/p diffracted by a
solid periodic grating with a slit distance of d receives a transverse amplitude modulation. In the far field, this generates focuses at angles defined by nλdB /d = sin ϑ.
Alternatively, the grating may consist of a standing light wave detuned from resonances. The standing wave will create a periodic optical potential, which imprints
a transverse phase modulation on the atomic beam. In the far field, the result will
be the same as for the solid grating. Each atom will evolve into a superposition of
momentum sidemodes ±n2~k, without any momentum having been transferred to
the atoms. The diffraction angle is again sin ϑ = ±n2~k/p = ±nλdB /(λ/2), where
λ/2 = d is the periodicity of the standing light wave. However, this is only true if
the phase shift is much smaller than π. This scheme is called the Raman-Nath regime
or the regime of Kapitza-Dirac scattering. An equivalent condition for this regime is,
that p
the interaction time is less than a period of oscillation in the optical potential,
τ  ~/ωrec /U , or vtrans τ  λ.
The Raman-Nath regime is realized by a very focused optical standing wave. A
wave that is not plane can be considered a superposition of many spatial modes. Since
(off-resonant) scattering (absorption followed by induced emission) corresponds to a
photon redistribution between spatial modes, in a tight waist the phase matching
condition is somewhat relaxed and minor corrections to the energy balance are possible. In a certain sense, Kapitza-Dirac scattering is the inverse process of ’forward
scattering’ of a laser beam passing through an atomic cloud: the roles of light and
atoms are exchanged. The requirement that the interaction time be short implies,
that the light grating is ’optically dilute’ for the atomic beam 10 .

28.2.4

Bragg spectroscopy of a condensate

To measure the Bogolubov spectrum, we need to excite perturbations in a condensate
and study its reaction [589].
Let us now imagine that the potential has the form of a standing wave. Technically
this can be done by two laser beams having the same frequency crossing at the position
of the atoms,

where the amplitudes of the perturbation, u(t) and v(t), only vary slowly in time. Assuming that ψ0 is fairly homogeneous, i.e. hψ0 |∇z |ψ0 i ' 0, the momentum transferred
to the BEC is,
hψ(r, t)| − ı~∇z |ψ(r, t)i = ~kz (|u|2 − |v|2 ) .

cloud can be optically dilute (or dense) for a laser beam.

Matter wave superradiance

28.3.1

Classical superradiance

The Bragg beam splitter introduced in the last section does not give rise to collective
scattering, even when the atoms are as strongly correlated as in a condensate. On the
other hand, collective scattering is known to occur in a classical gas: When two atoms
excited to an internal energy level, ∼ hc/λ, are separated by a distance R too large to
form a molecule, but smaller than the wavelength of the excited transition, aB  R 
λ, the atoms are coupled to the electromagnetic continuum by the same radiation that
they emit (see Fig. 28.11). The dipole moments of the atoms stimulate each other to
emit, and we observe a synchronized and accelerated relaxation, resulting in a coherent
and directional burst of radiation [175, 515]. The directionality of the radiation is due
to a destructive interference of the dipolar radiation patterns emitted by the atoms in
all directions except the direction chosen by the first emitted photon. This direction
is random (except when bosonically stimulated). The atomic sample evolves, during
this time, to a state of coherent superposition, until all the atoms are deexcited. This
phenomenon is called Dicke superradiance. A similar effect exists for matter waves,
and will be discussed in the following sections [313].

Figure 28.11: Superradiance assumes small interatomic distances compared to the wavelength of the excited dipole. Toroidal interference patterns interfering constructively in only
one direction.

28.3.2

Matter wave superradiance & CARL

We consider the process of Rayleigh scattering from a condensate. The scattering
rate obviously depends on the number of atoms and the laser intensity. The crucial
point now is, that this rate can be stimulated by populations in the output modes,
that is, the modes of scattered light and the atomic recoil modes. Matter and light

28.3. MATTER WAVE SUPERRADIANCE

1007

participate in the scattering process as equal partners. In Sec. 28.2.1 we showed that
Bragg scattering can be interpreted as optical stimulation of matter wave scattering.
By analogy, it is possible to imagine a process of wave matter stimulation of light
scattering. We will now discuss such a process, called superradiant Rayleigh scattering
or matter wave superradiance (MWSR) [313], with the help of the small cartoon shown
in Fig. 28.12. See also (watch talk).

Figure 28.12: Cartoon for MWSR (see text).

Let us imagine an elongated condensate, subject to a magnetic field directed along
its long axis and illuminated perpendicularly to the long axis by a linearly polarized
laser beam. The scattered light is emitted into a (toroidal) dipolar radiation pattern.
The fraction of the light scattered into the solid angle Ωj , which is inclined by angle ϑj
with respect to the polarization of the incident laser is Ωj sin2 ϑj /(8π/3). Of course,
the number of scattered photons also depends on the optical cross section σ and
the number of scattering atoms N0 . When an atom, recoiling due to the transfer of
one unit of photonic momentum, moves with a speed of a few centimeters per second
through the condensate, it interferes with other atoms of the condensate, thus forming
a wave matter grating. The grating, the lifetime of which is long in comparison to
the scattering rate, now stimulates subsequent photons to follow the same path Ωj
and receives, in turn, the scattering atoms. In other words, the bosonic stimulation of
the scattering process by the Nj atoms already populating the recoil mode amplifies
the photon scattering rate by a factor of Nj + 1. The differential optical cross section
(power Pj scattered into the direction Ωj divided by the laser intensity I) is [313],
Pj

(28.87)

Each scattering event of a photon into the mode Ωj transfers an atom to the recoil
mode Nj :
Ṅj = Pj /~ω ≡ Gj Nj

where

Gj =

(28.88)

The phase matching condition is satisfied for a solid angle of approximately Ωj =
λ2 /Aj , where Aj is the cross-sectional area of the condensate. If lj is the length of
condensate, we can write,
Gj =

I sin2 ϑj
σ
n0 λ2 lj .
~ω 8π/3

(28.89)

With the atomic density n0 = N0 /(Aj lj ), the factor n0 λ2 lj describes the optical
density of the BEC in the direction of the scattering. Therefore, we obtain exponential
gain for the atom number Nj , that is, the process is self-amplifying.

1008 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT
Using the terms of the dressed atom picture, we would say that the excited state
of our system is formed by the BEC and the laser mode. This state relaxes to a
state formed by the recoiled atoms and the scattered photons. The exponential gain
occurs, when this system exhibits inversion. The inversion is maintained, until the
BEC is completely transferred to the momentum recoil modes 11 .

Figure 28.13: Observation of matter wave superradiance.

It is instructive to compare Dicke superradiance and matter wave superradiance.
Dicke superradiance is induced by an electronic coherence between adjacent atoms.
It requires a sufficiently long coherence time for the atomic dipoles. On the other
hand, MWSR is a coherence effect between two states of the atomic center-of-mass
motion, i.e. the condensed state and a momentum sidemode. A long lifetime of this
coherence is necessary to allow for correlations between successive scattering events.
The coherence lifetime corresponds to a coherence length, which for a condensate
is equal to its physical size, whereas for a thermal cloud, it only corresponds to its
thermal Broglie wavelength. This explains why it is difficult to observe MWSR with
non-condensed atomic clouds.
Since the scattered photons quickly leave the BEC, there is no feedback or bosonic
stimulation by the optical output mode. This can be interpreted as a fast decaying
cavity mode, and the regime is called the bad cavity limit. Let us now imagine, that
the photons were recycled, for example, via an optical cavity constructed around the
BEC and reflecting back the photons emitted in the solid angle Ωj 12 . The mirrors of
the cavity create reflection images of the radiating atoms, which increase the density
of states, the scattering rate, and the gain Gj increase by a factor of 8F/π. An
interesting question now is, what happens in the limit F → ∞. If the decay of the
cavity mode, and therefore the removal of photons from the coherent interaction zone
(which is precisely the volume occupied by the BEC) is slow, the MWSR process
seems to be doubly stimulated, optically and atomically. However, in this case we
also expect the inverse process, where photons are scattered back to the original mode,
to occur and to be stimulated by the number of atoms N0 in the condensate. We see
that the simple picture of bosonic stimulation does not work in this case, and a more
11 Superradiant scattering is due to a nonlinear coupling between two matter waves and two optical
waves in a four-wave mixing process (4WM) interpreted as scattering of light from a wave matter
stimulated by a wave matter mode. The process does not require nonlinearity due to collisions, but
it works with an ideal gas, g → 0. This distinguishes it from the 4WM of four matter waves, studied
in Sec. 27.3.4 and interpreted as a scattering of atoms by a matter wave stimulated by matter wave
mode, and 4WM in quantum optics involving four photons. But in all cases bosonic stimulation is
crucial.
12 Alternatively, we may imagine a scheme decelerating of the group velocity of the light pulse.

complete model including the possibility of Rabi oscillations amplified by stimulated
emission is necessary 13 .

28.3.3

Amplification of matter and light waves

The feedback-induced exponential gain giving rise to the phenomenon of MWSR can
be used to construct a phase-coherent amplifier of matter and light waves. After all,
the momentum side modes observed in the MWSR process [313] already represent
amplified vacuum fluctuations. To experimentally realize a coherent matter wave amplifier [368, 315], it is sufficient to replace the vacuum fluctuations of the original
MWSR experiment with a small seed condensate: ∼ 0.1% of the ’mother condensate’
proved sufficient to stimulate the matter wave amplifier. The seed condensate was
created by Bragg diffraction transferring atoms from the mother BEC to another momentum state (see Sec. 28.2). The matter wave grating formed by interference of the
seed condensate and the mother BEC was subsequently amplified by a MWSR pulse.
The gain for the atom number in the seed condensate was 10 to 100 depending on the
intensity and duration of the MWSR pulse. Finally, the coherence of the amplification
process was demonstrated by active atom interferometry using the Ramsey scheme:
One of the interferometer arms consisted of the amplified seed condensate and the
other of a reference condensate (local oscillator) especially created by Bragg diffraction from the mother condensate. The observation of interference between these two
matter waves proved the coherence of the amplification process and the existence of a
well-defined phase relationship between the input and the output of the matter wave
amplifier.

Figure 28.14: Matter wave amplification of a ’seed condensate’ at the expense of a ’mother
condensate’. Time-of-flight imaging visualizes the condensate’s momentum distribution.

In analogy to electronics, we may consider the coherent matter wave amplifier
as an active device complementing the atom optical toolbox of passive devices (see
Sec. 27.3.1).
13 The phenomenon of the matter wave superradiance can be understood without quantization of
the atomic motion [?] and, in particular, without quantum degeneracy. A cold and dense thermal
cloud can show the phenomenon of MWSR [674]. The scattered light forms together with the pump
light, a propagating standing light wave, from which the atoms are scattered by Bragg diffraction.
Atoms are accelerated by the CARL effect [139, 80, 380, 444, 443, 368, 315, 314] through a coherent
redistribution of photons between the pump and scattered modes. However, as was shown later-on,
the different recoil modes of the condensate exhibit phase-coherence, which is not explained by a
theories treating the atomic motion semi-classically.

1010 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT

28.3.4

Four-wave mixing of optical and matter waves

We will now make an attempt to categorize the various scattering processes involving
condensates. Let us first return to the radiation pressure [Fig. 28.15(a)], where an
incident photon is spontaneously scattered into a random direction. The isotropy of
the scattering process can, however, be broken when certain directions (i.e. spatial
modes) are favored by bosonic stimulation. The symmetry of the roles of matter wave
modes and light modes allows us to treat both on the same footing, for example, we
can stimulate scattered modes either by matter of light waves.
Let us first have a look at stimulation by optical modes [Fig. 28.15(b) and (c)].
Fig. (b) describes optical four-wave mixing (4WM) in nonlinear optical media, i.e. optically stimulated scattering of photons from a standing light wave, which is a 4WM
process of 4 photons. Fig. (c) describes Bragg scattering, i.e. an optically stimulated
scattering of atoms by a standing light wave, which is a 4WM process of 2 photons
and 2 atoms.
Similarly, a scattering process can also be stimulated by a macroscopic number of
atoms in a recoil mode [Fig. 28.15(d) and (f)]. Fig. (d) describes superradiant Rayleigh
scattering and matter wave amplification, i.e. scattering of photons stimulated by a
de Broglie wave, which again corresponds to 4WM of 2 photons and two atoms.
Fig. (e) describes amplification of a laser pulse by superradiant Rayleigh scattering,
i.e. scattering of photons in a matter wave with double stimulation by light waves
and de Broglie waves, which once again is a 4WM process of 2 photons and 2 atoms.
Finally, Fig. (f) describes the basic process of nonlinear atom optics, i.e. the scattering
of atoms by a matter wave stimulated by de Broglie waves, which is a 4WM process
of 4 atoms.

Condensates in electronically excited states

The interaction between condensates and light has, so far, been treated in the limit
where the population of excited states can be neglected or adiabatically eliminated. An
example was the coherent coupling of different kinetic states of an atom by a method
called Bragg diffraction discussed in Sec. 28.2.
On the other hand, atoms can have metastable excited states, which can introduce
new degrees of freedom, and a whole world of new problems emerges that need to
be addressed: How do condensed atoms move, when they are in different states of
internal excitation (or superposition of states), and how do atoms in different states
interact with each other? We will now turn our attention to coherent coupling of
internal states 14 .
In Sec. 28.4.1 we will show how to generalize the second-quantized formalism
introduced in ?? in order to deal with coupled condensates in different states of
internal excitation.
In Sec. 28.4.2 we will discuss examples of how coherent coupling of two states can
be accomplished either by radiofrequency/microwave radiation or by two laser beams
in Raman configuration. In order to avoid spontaneous relaxation, we often choose
state with low excitation energy, for example, within the hyperfine structure (Ĥ ∼ I·J)
or the Zeeman structure (Ĥ ∼ µ · B) of the electronic ground state. But one can also
consider the coupling between different kinetic states of free atoms Ĥ ∼ p2 /2m, or
2 2
the output coupling of atoms confined to a trapping potential (Ĥ ∼ m
2 ω r ), or even
a chemical coupling between a vibrational state of two atoms bound together to form
a molecular and a state, where the same two atoms are free and involved in an elastic
collision.
Finally, in Sec. 28.4.3 we will show how to harness the forces induced by atom-light
coupling in order to design new geometries of trapping potentials.

28.4.1

Theory of the interaction of condensates with light

Let us consider two Bose-Einstein condensates in the mean-field approximation consistent of atoms in two different internal excitation states, ψ1 and ψ2 , separated by
the energy ~ω0 . We illuminate the BEC by a plane wave of monochromatic light with
the frequency ω. The formal procedure consists of constructing the Hamiltonian of
individual atoms, as done in Eq. (19.2), and then quantizing the field of matter [492],

where we allow for the fact that the trapping potentials can be different for the
two excitation states. We assume that atoms in different states of excitation are
14 We will disregard, for the moment, possible effects due to inhomogeneous broadening caused by
the finite volume of the cloud inside the potential (Zeeman shift in magnetic traps or dynamic Stark
shift optical traps) or effects due to interatomic interactions. But we have to keep in mind, that
interatomic interaction can have a big impact on the dynamics, because the chemical potential of
each condensate depends on its number of atoms. Thus, in view of the inhomogeneity of the trapping
potential, the transfer of atoms can excite oscillations and sound waves in the condensates.

STIRAP & adiabatic sweep

A frequent problem for experimenters is the need to transfer a magnetically trapped
atomic cloud from one Zeeman or hyperfine state to another. We will present here
two techniques called STImulated Raman Adiabatic Passage and adiabatic sweep.

1014 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT
28.4.2.1

Adiabatic sweep

To discuss the adiabatic sweep, we consider the example of a 87 Rb cloud trapped in
the state |F, mF i = |2, −2i. The application of resonant radiofrequency radiation to
the transition |2, −2i-|2, −1i also couples all other mF states and causes a diffusion of
the atomic populations toward an uncontrollable mixture of states. An alternative is
the application of a ramp sweeping the radiofrequency from red to blue (or vice versa).
Such a ramp is able to transfer the entire population toward the opposite Zeeman state
|2, +2i. To see this, we solve the Schrödinger equation, |ψ(t + dt)i = eıH dt |ψ(t)i,
iteratively,

The disadvantage of this method is that only the external (fully stretched) states
|mF | = F can be interconverted.
28.4.2.2

Sweep through a dark resonance

To discuss STIRAP, let us think of how to transfer atoms from the state |1i ≡ |2, 2i
to |2i ≡ |2, 1i. The general idea consists in applying two radiation fields with Rabi
frequencies Ω13 and Ω23 , tuned a bit out of resonance with an intermediate state |3i,
∆13 = ∆23 6= 0, in a counterintuitive pulse sequence. That is, the field Ω23 is applied
first and then adiabatically turned down, while the field Ω13 is ramped up. This
method is capable of transferring all atoms.
Considering the example of the preceding section, we will discuss here another
option (see Fig. 28.18). We consider continuous microwave fields with fixed tunings

28.4.3

Condensate in adiabatic potentials

Adiabatic potentials have already been introduced in Secs. 19.1.3 and 24.4.3. Here,
we will focus on the dynamics of condensed atoms in different states of electronic excitation, when these states are subject to different potentials and radiation fields that
can induce transitions between the states. In particular, we consider paramagnetic
atoms in different Zeeman states placed in inhomogeneous static magnetic fields and
subject to single-mode or multi-mode radiofrequency radiation fields [136]DOI . To
simplify the problem, let us concentrate on two-level systems, e.g. a system with the
total spin F = 12 [678]DOI , and only consider the one-dimensional case.

govern the impact of the collisions.
The interaction with the radiofrequency field leads to Rabi oscillations with frequency Ω 17 The tuning of the radiofrequency depends on the position, due to the

The adiabatic potentials follow from a point-wise diagonalization of the Hamiltonian,
assuming that the atomic movement evolves in sufficiently small steps.

One-dimensional case

The reduction of the dimensionality of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is shown in
Sec. ??. Applying this to our case, we consider a one-dimensional potential V (r) =

1018 CHAPTER 28. INTERACTION OF BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATES WITH LIGHT
28.4.3.3

Damping

A heuristic way of introducing damping could be as follows: We write down the
condensate velocity field as,
mv(r, t) = ~

φ̂∗ (r, t)∇φ̂(r, t) − ∇φ̂∗ (r, t)φ̂(r, t)
,
2ın(r, t)

(28.118)

and subject it to a friction force,
Ef r = −γrv .

(28.119)

The problem with the coupled GPE approach is that in the absence of damping
any even small modification of the coupling triggers collective oscillations, so that
the ground state is not found. A numerical method to minimize the total energy
cannot be used, because the minimum is the untrapped state, so that all atoms are
lost. It seems that a master equation approach is necessary to introduce damping.
An alternative (but cheap) way is the following. The coupled GPEs were written in
the dressed states basis. Thus, if the Rabi frequency is strong enough to completely
decouple the dressed states, the dressed states represent good quantum numbers, and
the GPEs are appropriately written in a diagonal basis, i.e. the GPEs decouple on
adiabatic potentials 18 ,

Interaction between condensates and optical
cavities

In 28.4.1 we have set up the many-body Hamiltonian (28.96) describing the interaction
of a matter wave (treated in mean-field approximation) with an incident light field.
We emphasized the role of photonic recoil in (28.121). In the following sections we
aim at applying this theory to the particular case of atoms interacting with two
counterpropagating modes of an optical ring cavity. The system has already been
studied in Chp. 22.6.1 in the context of CARL, where the atomic motion, as well as
the light fields, have mostly been treated classically.
CARL is based on a coherent redistribution of photons between the two counterpropagating modes of a moving standing light wave mediated by atoms which
18 Gravitation

can be included by Vad,k (z) → Vad,k (z) + mgz.

28.5. INTERACTION BETWEEN CONDENSATES AND OPTICAL CAVITIES1019
are located in the mode volume. Cooperative Compton scattering induces a collective atomic recoil and a self-bunching of the atoms, which results in an exponential gain for the optical mode receiving the scattered photons. The recent observation of the MWSR [313] in a BEC raises the question about an ultra-cold version
of CARL [444, 298]. In MWSR the long coherence time of a BEC establishes a
strong correlation between subsequent elastic Rayleigh scattering events mediated
by very stable quasi-particle excitations. The feedback of these excitations on the
laser creates an exponential gain for the optical mode receiving the scattered photons
[314, 139, 80, 380, 444, 443, 368, 315, 314].
We have discussed the classical CARL earlier in the superradiant as well as the
good-cavity regime. We have also generalized the problem to the case of quantized
atomic motion (see Sec. ??) and to quantized radiation fields (see Sec. ??). The
internal states were always adiabatically eliminated. In the following, we will fully
quantize the bosonic atomic particle field.
The advantages of this second quantization is that interatomic interactions, quantum fluctuations, and decoherence of the matter wave can be taken into account.
Various proposals have been made focusing on either one of the above three aspects.
Fundamental aspects of the BEC-in-a-cavity-system lead into two directions: 1. quantum synchronization and 2. quantum correlations.
The system under consideration is a BEC of two-level atoms with transition resonance frequency ω0 trapped in an external magnetic trap, located inside the mode
volume of a ring cavity and interacting with its light modes. The atomic field operators obey the commutation relations,

†

†

where k, m = 1, 2 label the internal state of the atoms. In general, the light field
consists of only two counterpropagating monochromatic modes with Rabi frequencies
2gâ†± â± . Choosing the coordinate system properly, we can set the wavevectors of
the modes as k+ · êr = kẑ = −k− · êr . The second-quantized Hamiltonian is a
generalization of (22.4),

H = Hatom + Hatom−atom + Hatom−cav + Ĥcav + Ĥlaser−cav ,

Various approximations can be made depending on the subject of interest. For
example, if only one cavity mode, â+ , is strongly pumped, such that the field becomes

28.5.1

Ideal gas Hamiltonian after adiabatic elimination

Assuming the light fields to be tuned far from resonance we disregard spontaneous
emission, as explained in Sec. 22.1.2, and adiabatically eliminate the internal states,
as shown in Sec. 22.1.3 [500, 125]. On the other hand, we treat the light field and the
atomic motion in second quantization. The canonical way to describe a BEC interacting with two optical modes â± is to second-quantize the single-particle Hamiltonian

BECs in two internal states coupled by a cavity

A lossy cavity can act as an effective zero temperature reservoir. One possible implementation [325] realizes a three-level cycling scheme, with two BECs in two ground
states |g1 i and |g2 i coherently coupled by a two-photon transition (Raman-lasers or
microwave-radiofrequency combination). The ground states are additionally coupled
by an irreversible Raman transition via an intermediate spontaneously decaying level
|ei. One transition is not driven but stimulated by a ring cavity mode â.

Oscillation simulates Doppler shift of thermal motion in Doppler cooling. Raman scattering takes the role of spontaneous emission in the cooling process.
The only role of the cavity is to introduce irreversibility. Raman scattering is
only supported in one direction: However, it is not relevant to have a ring cavity.
